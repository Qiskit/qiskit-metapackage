Quantum computing in a nutshell
===============================

Introduction
============

Quantum computing represents a new paradigm in computation that utilizes the fundamental
principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations.  If you are reading this then you 
have undoubtedly heard that the promise of quantum computation lies in the possibility of
efficiently performing a handful of tasks such as prime factorization and quantum simulation;
computations that at size are beyond the capabilities of even the largest of classical computers.

The power of quantum computing rests on two cornerstones of quantum mechanics, **superposition** and 
**entanglement** that highlight the wave- and particle-like aspects of quantum computation, and are
manifestations of the famous
`wave-particle duality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality>`_
of quantum mechanics.

Superposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like a classical computer, a quantum computer operates on bits.  However, while classical bits can
only be found in the states 0 and 1, a quantum bit, or qubit, can represent the values 0 and 1, 
or linear combinations of both.  These linear combinations are known as **superpositions** 
(or superposition states) and allow for representing, and processing, exponentially many
logical states at once.

To see how this resource is utilized in quantum computation we first turn toward a classical
analogy: noise cancellation.  





The vast majority of quantum superpositions, and the ones most useful for quantum computation, 
are entangled. Entangled states are states of the whole computer that do not correspond to any 
assignment of digital or analog states of the individual qubits. A quantum computer is therefore 
significantly more powerful than any one classical computer â€” whether it be deterministic, 
probabilistic, or analog.
