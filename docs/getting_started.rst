===========================
Getting Started with Qiskit
===========================

The workflow of using Qiskit consists of three high-level steps:

- **Build**: design a quantum circuit that represents the problem you are
  considering.
- **Execute**: run experiments on different backends (*which include both
  systems and simulators*).
- **Analyze**: calculate summary statistics and visualize the results of
  experiments.

Here is an example of the entire workflow, with each step explained in detail in
subsequent sections:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qiskit import(
      QuantumCircuit,
      QuantumRegister,
      ClassicalRegister,
      execute,
      Aer)
    from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

    # Use Aer's qasm_simulator
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

    # Create a Quantum Register with 2 qubits.
    q = QuantumRegister(2)

    # Create a Classical Register with 2 bits.
    c = ClassicalRegister(2)

    # Create a Quantum Circuit acting on the q register
    circ = QuantumCircuit(q,c)

    # Add a H gate on qubit 0
    circ.h(q[0])

    # Add a CX (CNOT) gate on control qubit 0 and target qubit 1
    circ.cx(q[0],q[1])

    # Map the quantum measurement to the classical bits
    circ.measure(q,c)

    # Execute the circuit on the qasm simulator
    job = execute(circ, simulator, shots=1024)

    # Grab results from the job
    result = job.result()

    # Returns counts
    counts = result.get_counts(circ)
    print("\nTotal count for 00 and 11 are:",counts)

    # Draw the circuit
    circ.draw(output='mpl')

.. code-block:: text

    Total count for 00 and 11 are: {'00': 487, '11': 537}

-----------------------
Workflow Step--by--Step
-----------------------

The program above can be broken down into six steps:

1. Import packages
2. Initialize variables
3. Add gates
4. Visualize the circuit
5. Simulate the experiment
6. Visualize the results


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 1 : Import Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic elements needed for your program are imported as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  from qiskit import(
    QuantumCircuit,
    QuantumRegister,
    ClassicalRegister,
    execute,
    Aer)
  from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

In more detail, the imports are

- ``QuantumCircuit``: can be thought as the instructions of the quantum system.
  It holds all your quantum operations.
- ``QuantumRegister``: holds your qubits.
- ``ClassicalRegister``: stores classical bits.
- ``execute``: runs your circuit / experiment.
- ``Aer``: handles simulator backends.
- ``plot_histogram``: creates histograms.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 2 : Initialize Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the next three lines of code

.. code-block:: python

    q = QuantumRegister(2)
    c = ClassicalRegister(2)
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(q,c)

Here, you are initializing ``q`` with 2 qubits in the zero state; ``c`` with 2
classical bits set to zero; and ``circuit`` is the quantum circuit that
comprises ``q`` and ``c``.

Syntax:

- ``QuantumRegister(number_of_qubits)``
- ``ClassicalRegister(number_of_bits)``
- ``QuantumCircuit(QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister)``



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 3 : Add Gates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add gates (operations) to manipulate the registers of your circuit.

Consider the following three lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

    circuit.h(q[0])
    circuit.cx(q[0], q[1])
    circuit.measure(q,c)

The gates are added to the circuit one-by-one to form the Bell state

.. math:: |\psi\rangle = \left(|00\rangle+|11\rangle\right)/\sqrt{2}.

The code above applies the following gates:

- ``QuantumCircuit.h(QuantumRegister)``: A Hadamard gate :math:`H` on qubit 0,
  which puts it into a **superposition state**.
- ``QuantumCircuit.cx(QuantumRegister)``: A controlled-Not operation
  (:math:`C_{X}`) on control qubit 0 and target qubit 1, putting the qubits in
  an **entangled state**.
- ``QuantumCircuit.measure(QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister)``: if you pass
  the entire quantum and classical registers to ``measure``, the ith qubitâ€™s
  measurement result will be stored in the ith classical bit.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 4 : Visualize the Circuit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use ``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` to view the circuit that you have designed
in the :ref:`various forms <Visualizing a Quantum Circuit>` used in many
textbooks and research articles.

.. code-block:: python

    circuit.draw(output='mpl')

.. image:: images/figures/getting_started_1_1.png
   :alt: Quantum circuit to make a Bell state.

In this circuit, the qubits are ordered with qubit zero at the top and
qubit one at the bottom. The circuit is read left-to-right, meaning that gates
which are applied earlier in the circuit show up farther to the left.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 5 : Simulate the Experiment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qiskit Aer is a high performance simulator framework for quantum circuits. It
provides :ref:`several backends <executing_quantum_programs>` to achieve
different simulation goals.

To simulate this circuit, you will use the ``qasm_simulator``. Each run of this
circuit will yield either the bit string 00 or 11.

.. code-block:: python

    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    job = execute(circ, simulator, shots=1000)
    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts(circ)
    print("\nTotal count for 00 and 11 are:",counts)


.. code-block:: text

    Total count for 00 and 11 are: {'00': 514, '11': 510}

As expected, the output bit string is 00 approximately 50 percent of the time.
The number of times the circuit is run can be specified via the ``shots``
argument of the ``execute`` method. The number of shots of the simulation was
set to be 1000 (the default is 1024).

Once you have a ``result`` object, you can access the counts via the method
``get_counts(circuit)``. This gives you the aggregate outcomes of the
experiment you ran.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Step 6 : Visualize the Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qiskit provides :ref:`many visualizations <plotting_data_in_qiskit>`, including
the function ``plot_histogram``, to view your results.

.. code-block:: python

    plot_histogram(counts)

.. image:: ./images/figures/getting_started_14_0.png
   :alt: Histogram of results.

The observed probabilities :math:`Pr(00)` and :math:`Pr(11)` are computed by
taking the respective counts and dividing by the total number of shots.

.. note::
  Try changing the ``shots`` keyword in the ``execute`` method to see how
  the estimated probabilities change.
