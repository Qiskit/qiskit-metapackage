Ignis 0.1
=========

No Change

Aqua 0.5
========

No Change

IBM Q Provider 0.3
==================

The ``IBMQProvider`` has been updated in order to default to using the new
`IBM Q Experience v2 <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com>`__. Accessing the legacy IBM Q Experience v1 and QConsole
will still be supported during the 0.3.x line until its final deprecation one
month from the release. It is encouraged to update to the new IBM Q
Experience to take advantage of the new functionality and features.

Updating to the new IBM Q Experience v2
---------------------------------------

If you have credentials for the legacy IBM Q Experience stored on disk, you
can make use of the interactive helper::

    from qiskit import IBMQ

    IBMQ.update_account()


For more complex cases or fine tuning your configuration, the following methods
are available:

* the ``IBMQ.delete_accounts()`` can be used for resetting your configuration
  file.
* the ``IBMQ.save_account('MY_TOKEN')`` method can be used for saving your
  credentials, following the instructions in the `IBM Q Experience v2 <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com>`__
  account page.

Updating your programs
----------------------

When using the new IBM Q Experience v2 through the provider, access to backends
is done via individual ``provider`` instances (as opposed to accessing them
directly through the ``qiskit.IBMQ`` object as in previous versions), which
allows for more granular control over the project you are using.

You can get a reference to the ``providers`` that you have access to using the
``IBMQ.providers()`` and ``IBMQ.get_provider()`` methods::

    from qiskit import IBMQ

    provider = IBMQ.load_account()
    my_providers = IBMQ.providers()
    provider_2 = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='A', group='B', project='C')


For convenience, ``IBMQ.load_account()`` and ``IBMQ.enable_account()`` will
return a provider for the open access project, which is the default in the new
IBM Q Experience v2.

For example, the following program in previous versions::

    from qiskit import IBMQ

    IBMQ.load_accounts()
    backend = IBMQ.get_backend('ibmqx4')
    backend_2 = IBMQ.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator', hub='HUB2')

Would be equivalent to the following program in the current version::

    from qiskit import IBMQ

    provider = IBMQ.load_account()
    backend = provider.get_backend('ibmqx4')
    provider_2 = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='HUB2')
    backend_2 = provider_2.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')

You can find more information and details in the `IBM Q Provider documentation <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider>`__.

  maps.
- Support for parameterized circuits.
- The ``PassManager`` interface has been improved and new functions added for
  easier interaction and usage with custom pass managers.
- Preset ``PassManager``\s are now included which offer a predetermined pipeline
  of transpiler passes.
- User configuration files to let local environments override default values
  for some functions.
- New transpiler passes: ``EnlargeWithAncilla``, ``Unroll2Q``,
  ``NoiseAdaptiveLayout``, ``OptimizeSwapBeforeMeasure``,
  ``RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure``, ``CommutativeCancellation``,
  ``Collect2qBlocks``, and ``ConsolidateBlocks``.


Compatibility Considerations
----------------------------

As part of the 0.8 release the following things have been deprecated and will
either be removed or changed in a backwards incompatible manner in a future
release. While not strictly necessary these are things to adjust for before the
0.9 (unless otherwise noted) release to avoid a breaking change in the future.

* The methods prefixed by ``_get`` in the ``DAGCircuit`` object are being
  renamed without that prefix.
* Changed elements in ``couplinglist`` of ``CouplingMap`` from tuples to lists.
* Unroller bases must now be explicit, and violation raises an informative
  ``QiskitError``.
* The ``qiskit.tools.qcvv`` package is deprecated and will be removed in the in
  the future. You should migrate to using the Qiskit Ignis which replaces this
  module.
* The ``qiskit.compile()`` function is now deprecated in favor of explicitly
  using the ``qiskit.compiler.transpile()`` function to transform a circuit,
  followed by ``qiskit.compiler.assemble()`` to make a Qobj out of
  it. Instead of ``compile(...)``, use ``assemble(transpile(...), ...)``.
* ``qiskit.converters.qobj_to_circuits()`` has been deprecated and will be
  removed in a future release. Instead
  ``qiskit.assembler.disassemble()`` should be used to extract
  ``QuantumCircuit`` objects from a compiled Qobj.
* The ``qiskit.mapper`` namespace has been deprecated. The ``Layout`` and
  ``CouplingMap`` classes can be accessed via ``qiskit.transpiler``.
* A few functions in ``qiskit.tools.qi.qi`` have been deprecated and
  moved to ``qiskit.quantum_info``.

Please note that some backwards incompatible changes have been made during this
release. The following notes contain information on how to adapt to these
changes.

IBM Q Provider
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IBM Q provider was previously included in Terra, but it has been split out
into a separate package ``qiskit-ibmq-provider``. This will need to be
installed, either via pypi with ``pip install qiskit-ibmq-provider`` or from
source in order to access ``qiskit.IBMQ`` or ``qiskit.providers.ibmq``. If you
install qiskit with ``pip install qiskit``, that will automatically install
all subpackages of the Qiskit project.



Cython Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting in the 0.8 release the core stochastic swap routine is now implemented
in `Cython <https://cython.org/>`__. This was done to significantly improve the performance of the
swapper, however if you build Terra from source or run on a non-x86 or other
platform without prebuilt wheels and install from source distribution you'll
need to make sure that you have Cython installed prior to installing/building
Qiskit Terra. This can easily be done with pip/pypi: ``pip install Cython``.




Compiler Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``qiskit.compile()`` function has been deprecated and replaced by first
calling ``qiskit.compiler.transpile()`` to run optimization and mapping on a
circuit, and then ``qiskit.compiler.assemble()`` to build a Qobj from that
optimized circuit to send to a backend. While this is only a deprecation it
will emit a warning if you use the old ``qiskit.compile()`` call.

**transpile(), assemble(), execute() parameters**

These functions are heavily overloaded and accept a wide range of inputs.
They can handle circuit and pulse inputs. All kwargs except for ``backend``
for these functions now also accept lists of the previously accepted types.
The ``initial_layout`` kwarg can now be supplied as a both a list and dictionary,
e.g. to map a Bell experiment on qubits 13 and 14, you can supply:
``initial_layout=[13, 14]`` or ``initial_layout={qr[0]: 13, qr[1]: 14}``



Qobj
^^^^

The Qobj class has been split into two separate subclasses depending on the
use case, either ``PulseQobj`` or ``QasmQobj`` for pulse and circuit jobs
respectively. If you're interacting with Qobj directly you may need to
adjust your usage accordingly.

The ``qiskit.qobj.qobj_to_dict()`` is removed. Instead use the ``to_dict()``
method of a Qobj object.



Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The largest change to the visualization module is it has moved from
``qiskit.tools.visualization`` to ``qiskit.visualization``. This was done to
indicate that the visualization module is more than just a tool. However, since
this interface was declared stable in the 0.7 release the public interface off
of ``qiskit.tools.visualization`` will continue to work. That may change in a
future release, but it will be deprecated prior to removal if that happens.

The previously deprecated functions, ``plot_circuit()``,
``latex_circuit_drawer()``, ``generate_latex_source()``, and
``matplotlib_circuit_drawer()`` from ``qiskit.tools.visualization`` have been
removed. Instead of these functions, calling
``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` with the appropriate arguments should
be used.

The previously deprecated ``plot_barriers`` and ``reverse_bits`` keys in
the ``style`` kwarg dictionary are deprecated, instead the
``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` kwargs ``plot_barriers`` and
``reverse_bits`` should be used.

The Wigner plotting functions ``plot_wigner_function``, ``plot_wigner_curve``,
``plot_wigner_plaquette``, and ``plot_wigner_data`` previously in the
``qiskit.tools.visualization._state_visualization`` module have been removed.
They were never exposed through the public stable interface and were not well
documented. The code to use this feature can still be accessed through the
qiskit-tutorials repository.



Mapper
^^^^^^

The public api from ``qiskit.mapper`` has been moved into ``qiskit.transpiler``.
While it has only been deprecated in this release, it will be removed in the
0.9 release so updating your usage of ``Layout`` and ``CouplingMap`` to import
from ``qiskit.transpiler`` instead of ``qiskit.mapper`` before that takes place
will avoid any surprises in the future.

IBM Q Provider 0.1
==================

New Features
------------

- This is the first release as a standalone package. If you
  are installing Terra standalone you'll also need to install the
  ``qiskit-ibmq-provider`` package with ``pip install qiskit-ibmq-provider`` if
  you want to use the IBM Q backends.

- Support for non-Qobj format jobs has been removed from
  the provider. You'll have to convert submissions in an older format to
  Qobj before you can submit.



**********
Qiskit 0.8
**********

In Qiskit 0.8 we introduced the Qiskit Ignis element. It also includes the
Qiskit Terra element 0.7.1 release which contains a bug fix for the BasicAer
Python simulator.

**********
Qiskit 0.7
**********

In Qiskit 0.7 we introduced Qiskit Aer and combined it with Qiskit Terra.



Terra 0.7
=========

New Features
------------

This release includes several new features and many bug fixes. With this release
the interfaces for circuit diagram, histogram, bloch vectors, and state
visualizations are declared stable. Additionally, this release includes a
defined and standardized bit order/endianness throughout all aspects of Qiskit.
These are all declared as stable interfaces in this release which won't have
breaking changes made moving forward, unless there is appropriate and lengthy
deprecation periods warning of any coming changes.

There is also the introduction of the following new features:

- A new ASCII art circuit drawing output mode
- A new circuit drawing interface off of ``QuantumCircuit`` objects that
  enables calls of ``circuit.draw()`` or ``print(circuit)`` to render a drawing
  of circuits
- A visualizer for drawing the DAG representation of a circuit
- A new quantum state plot type for hinton diagrams in the local matplotlib
  based state plots
- 2 new constructor methods off the ``QuantumCircuit`` class
  ``from_qasm_str()`` and ``from_qasm_file()`` which let you easily create a
  circuit object from OpenQASM
- A new function ``plot_bloch_multivector()`` to plot Bloch vectors from a
  tensored state vector or density matrix
- Per-shot measurement results are available in simulators and select devices.
  These can be accessed by setting the ``memory`` kwarg to ``True`` when
  calling ``compile()`` or ``execute()`` and then accessed using the
  ``get_memory()`` method on the ``Result`` object.
- A ``qiskit.quantum_info`` module with revamped Pauli objects and methods for
  working with quantum states
- New transpile passes for circuit analysis and transformation:
  ``CommutationAnalysis``, ``CommutationTransformation``, ``CXCancellation``,
  ``Decompose``, ``Unroll``, ``Optimize1QGates``, ``CheckMap``,
  ``CXDirection``, ``BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements``
- New alternative swap mapper passes in the transpiler:
  ``BasicSwap``, ``LookaheadSwap``, ``StochasticSwap``
- More advanced transpiler infrastructure with support for analysis passes,
  transformation passes, a global ``property_set`` for the pass manager, and
  repeat-until control of passes



Compatibility Considerations
----------------------------

As part of the 0.7 release the following things have been deprecated and will
either be removed or changed in a backwards incompatible manner in a future
release. While not strictly necessary these are things to adjust for before the
next release to avoid a breaking change.

- ``plot_circuit()``, ``latex_circuit_drawer()``, ``generate_latex_source()``,
  and ``matplotlib_circuit_drawer()`` from qiskit.tools.visualization are
  deprecated. Instead the ``circuit_drawer()`` function from the same module
  should be used, there are kwarg options to mirror the functionality of all
  the deprecated functions.
- The current default output of ``circuit_drawer()`` (using latex and falling
  back on python) is deprecated and will be changed to just use the ``text``
  output by default in future releases.
- The ``qiskit.wrapper.load_qasm_string()`` and
  ``qiskit.wrapper.load_qasm_file()`` functions are deprecated and the
  ``QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str()`` and
  ``QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file()`` constructor methods should be used
  instead.
- The ``plot_barriers`` and ``reverse_bits`` keys in the ``style`` kwarg
  dictionary are deprecated, instead the
  ``qiskit.tools.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` kwargs ``plot_barriers`` and
  ``reverse_bits`` should be used instead.
- The functions ``plot_state()`` and ``iplot_state()`` have been depreciated.
  Instead the functions ``plot_state_*()`` and ``iplot_state_*()`` should be
  called for the visualization method required.
- The ``skip_transpiler`` argumentt has been deprecated from ``compile()`` and
  ``execute()``. Instead you can use the ``PassManager`` directly, just set
  the ``pass_manager`` to a blank ``PassManager`` object with ``PassManager()``
- The ``transpile_dag()`` function ``format`` kwarg for emitting different
  output formats is deprecated, instead you should convert the default output
  ``DAGCircuit`` object to the desired format.
- The unrollers have been deprecated, moving forward only DAG to DAG unrolling
  will be supported.

Please note that some backwards-incompatible changes have been made during this
release. The following notes contain information on how to adapt to these
changes.

Changes to Result objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of the rewrite of the Results object to be more consistent and a
stable interface moving forward a few changes have been made to how you access
the data stored in the result object. First the ``get_data()`` method has been
renamed to just ``data()``. Accompanying that change is a change in the data
format returned by the function. It is now returning the raw data from the
backends instead of doing any post-processing. For example, in previous
versions you could call::

   result = execute(circuit, backend).result()
   unitary = result.get_data()['unitary']
   print(unitary)

and that would return the unitary matrix like::

   [[1+0j, 0+0.5j], [0-0.5j][-1+0j]]

But now if you call (with the renamed method)::

   result.data()['unitary']

it will return something like::

   [[[1, 0], [0, -0.5]], [[0, -0.5], [-1, 0]]]

To get the post processed results in the same format as before the 0.7 release
you must use the ``get_counts()``, ``get_statevector()``, and ``get_unitary()``
methods on the result object instead of ``get_data()['counts']``,
``get_data()['statevector']``, and ``get_data()['unitary']`` respectively.

Additionally, support for ``len()`` and indexing on a ``Result`` object has
been removed. Instead you should deal with the output from the post processed
methods on the Result objects.

Also, the ``get_snapshot()`` and ``get_snapshots()`` methods from the
``Result`` class have been removed. Instead you can access the snapshots
using ``Result.data()['snapshots']``.


Changes to Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The largest change made to visualization in the 0.7 release is the removal of
Matplotlib and other visualization dependencies from the project requirements.
This was done to simplify the requirements and configuration required for
installing Qiskit. If you plan to use any visualizations (including all the
jupyter magics) except for the ``text``, ``latex``, and ``latex_source``
output for the circuit drawer you'll you must manually ensure that
the visualization dependencies are installed. You can leverage the optional
requirements to the Qiskit Terra package to do this::

   pip install qiskit-terra[visualization]

Aside from this there have been changes made to several of the interfaces
as part of the stabilization which may have an impact on existing code.
The first is the the ``basis`` kwarg in the ``circuit_drawer()`` function
is no longer accepted. If you were relying on the ``circuit_drawer()`` to
adjust the basis gates used in drawing a circuit diagram you will have to
do this priort to calling ``circuit_drawer()``. For example::

   from qiskit.tools import visualization
   visualization.circuit_drawer(circuit, basis_gates='x,U,CX')

will have to be adjust to be::

   from qiskit import BasicAer
   from qiskit import transpiler
   from qiskit.tools import visualization
   backend = BasicAer.backend('qasm_simulator')
   draw_circ = transpiler.transpile(circuit, backend, basis_gates='x,U,CX')
   visualization.circuit_drawer(draw_circ)

Moving forward the ``circuit_drawer()`` function will be the sole interface
for circuit drawing in the visualization module. Prior to the 0.7 release there
were several other functions which either used different output backends or
changed the output for drawing circuits. However, all those other functions
have been deprecated and that functionality has been integrated as options
on ``circuit_drawer()``.

For the other visualization functions, ``plot_histogram()`` and
``plot_state()`` there are also a few changes to check when upgrading. First
is the output from these functions has changed, in prior releases these would
interactively show the output visualization. However that has changed to
instead return a ``matplotlib.Figure`` object. This provides much more
flexibility and options to interact with the visualization prior to saving or
showing it. This will require adjustment to how these functions are consumed.
For example, prior to this release when calling::

   plot_histogram(counts)
   plot_state(rho)

would open up new windows (depending on matplotlib backend) to display the
visualization. However starting in the 0.7 you'll have to call ``show()`` on
the output to mirror this behavior. For example::

   plot_histogram(counts).show()
   plot_state(rho).show()

or::

   hist_fig = plot_histogram(counts)
   state_fig = plot_state(rho)
   hist_fig.show()
   state_fig.show()

Note that this is only for when running outside of Jupyter. No adjustment is
required inside a Jupyter environment because Jupyter notebooks natively
understand how to render ``matplotlib.Figure`` objects.

However, returning the Figure object provides additional flexibility for
dealing with the output. For example instead of just showing the figure you
can now directly save it to a file by leveraging the ``savefig()`` method.
For example::

   hist_fig = plot_histogram(counts)
   state_fig = plot_state(rho)
   hist_fig.savefig('histogram.png')
   state_fig.savefig('state_plot.png')

The other key aspect which has changed with these functions is when running
under jupyter. In the 0.6 release ``plot_state()`` and ``plot_histogram()``
when running under jupyter the default behavior was to use the interactive
Javascript plots if the externally hosted Javascript library for rendering
the visualization was reachable over the network. If not it would just use
the matplotlib version. However in the 0.7 release this no longer the case,
and separate functions for the interactive plots, ``iplot_state()`` and
``iplot_histogram()`` are to be used instead. ``plot_state()`` and
``plot_histogram()`` always use the matplotlib versions.

Additionally, starting in this release the ``plot_state()`` function is
deprecated in favor of calling individual methods for each method of plotting
a quantum state. While the ``plot_state()`` function will continue to work
until the 0.9 release, it will emit a warning each time it is used. The

==================================  ========================
Qiskit Terra 0.6                    Qiskit Terra 0.7+
==================================  ========================
plot_state(rho)                     plot_state_city(rho)
plot_state(rho, method='city')      plot_state_city(rho)
plot_state(rho, method='paulivec')  plot_state_paulivec(rho)
plot_state(rho, method='qsphere')   plot_state_qsphere(rho)
plot_state(rho, method='bloch')     plot_bloch_multivector(rho)
plot_state(rho, method='hinton')    plot_state_hinton(rho)
==================================  ========================

The same is true for the interactive JS equivalent, ``iplot_state()``. The
function names are all the same, just with a prepended `i` for each function.
For example, ``iplot_state(rho, method='paulivec')`` is
``iplot_state_paulivec(rho)``.

Changes to Backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the improvements made in the 0.7 release there are a few things related
to backends to keep in mind when upgrading. The biggest change is the
restructuring of the provider instances in the root  ``qiskit``` namespace.
The ``Aer`` provider is not installed by default and requires the installation
of the ``qiskit-aer`` package. This package contains the new high performance
fully featured simulator. If you installed via ``pip install qiskit`` you'll
already have this installed. The python simulators are now available under
``qiskit.BasicAer`` and the old C++ simulators are available with
``qiskit.LegacySimulators``. This also means that the implicit fallback to
python based simulators when the C++ simulators are not found doesn't exist
anymore. If you ask for a local C++ based simulator backend, and it can't be
found an exception will be raised instead of just using the python simulator
instead.

Additionally the previously deprecation top level functions ``register()`` and
``available_backends()`` have been removed. Also, the deprecated
``backend.parameters()`` and ``backend.calibration()`` methods have been
removed in favor of ``backend.properties()``. You can refer to the 0.6 release
notes section :ref:`backends` for more details on these changes.

The ``backend.jobs()`` and ``backend.retrieve_jobs()`` calls no longer return
results from those jobs. Instead you must call the ``result()`` method on the
returned jobs objects.

Changes to the compiler, transpiler, and unrollers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of an effort to stabilize the compiler interfaces there have been
several changes to be aware of when leveraging the compiler functions.
First it is important to note that the ``qiskit.transpiler.transpile()``
function now takes a QuantumCircuit object (or a list of them) and returns
a QuantumCircuit object (or a list of them). The DAG processing is done
internally now.

You can also easily switch between circuits, DAGs, and Qobj now using the
functions in ``qiskit.converters``.




Aer 0.1
=======

New Features
------------

Aer provides three simulator backends:

- ``QasmSimulator``: simulate experiments and return measurement outcomes
- ``StatevectorSimulator``: return the final statevector for a quantum circuit
  acting on the all zero state
- ``UnitarySimulator``: return the unitary matrix for a quantum circuit

``noise`` module: contains advanced noise modeling features for the
``QasmSimulator``

- ``NoiseModel``, ``QuantumError``, ``ReadoutError`` classes for simulating a
  Qiskit quantum circuit in the presence of errors
- ``errors`` submodule including functions for generating ``QuantumError``
  objects for the following types of quantum errors: Kraus, mixed unitary,
  coherent unitary, Pauli, depolarizing, thermal relaxation, amplitude damping,
  phase damping, combined phase and amplitude damping
- ``device`` submodule for automatically generating a noise model based on the
  ``BackendProperties`` of a device

``utils`` module:

- ``qobj_utils`` provides functions for directly modifying a Qobj to insert
  special simulator instructions not yet supported through the Qiskit Terra API.


Aqua 0.4
========

New Features
------------

- Programmatic APIs for algorithms and components -- each component can now be
  instantiated and initialized via a single (non-emptY) constructot call
- ``QuantumInstance`` API for algorithm/backend decoupling --
  ``QuantumInstance`` encapsulates a backend and its settings
- Updated documentation and Jupyter Notebooks illustrating the new programmatic
  APIs
- Transparent parallelization for gradient-based optimizers
- Multiple-Controlled-NOT (cnx) operation
- Pluggable algorithmic component ``RandomDistribution``
- Concrete implementations of ``RandomDistribution``:
  ``BernoulliDistribution``, ``LogNormalDistribution``,
  ``MultivariateDistribution``, ``MultivariateNormalDistribution``,
  ``MultivariateUniformDistribution``, ``NormalDistribution``,
  ``UniformDistribution``, and ``UnivariateDistribution``
- Concrete implementations of ``UncertaintyProblem``:
  ``FixedIncomeExpectedValue``, ``EuropeanCallExpectedValue``, and
  ``EuropeanCallDelta``
- Amplitude Estimation algorithm
- Qiskit Optimization: New Ising models for optimization problems exact cover,
  set packing, vertex cover, clique, and graph partition
- Qiskit AI:

  - New feature maps extending the ``FeatureMap`` pluggable interface:
    ``PauliExpansion`` and ``PauliZExpansion``
  - Training model serialization/deserialization mechanism

- Qiskit Finance:

  - Amplitude estimation for Bernoulli random variable: illustration of
    amplitude estimation on a single qubit problem
  - Loading of multiple univariate and multivariate random distributions
  - European call option: expected value and delta (using univariate
    distributions)
  - Fixed income asset pricing: expected value (using multivariate
    distributions)

- The Pauli string in ``Operator`` class is aligned with Terra 0.7. Now the
  order of a n-qubit pauli string is ``q_{n-1}...q{0}`` Thus, the (de)serialier
  (``save_to_dict`` and ``load_from_dict``) in the ``Operator`` class are also
  changed to adopt the changes of ``Pauli`` class.

Compatibility Considerations
----------------------------

- ``HartreeFock`` component of pluggable type ``InitialState`` moved to Qiskit
  Chemistry
- ``UCCSD`` component of pluggable type ``VariationalForm`` moved to Qiskit
  Chemistry


**********
Qiskit 0.6
**********

Terra 0.6
=========

Highlights
----------

This release includes a redesign of internal components centered around a new,
formal communication format (Qobj), along with long awaited features to
improve the user experience as a whole. The highlights, compared to the 0.5
release, are:

- Improvements for inter-operability (based on the Qobj specification) and
  extensibility (facilities for extending Qiskit with new backends in a
  seamless way)
- New options for handling credentials and authentication for the IBM Q
  backends, aimed at simplifying the process and supporting automatic loading
  of user credentials
- A revamp of the visualization utilities: stylish interactive visualizations
  are now available for Jupyter users, along with refinements for the circuit
  drawer (including a matplotlib-based version)
- Performance improvements centered around circuit transpilation: the basis for
  a more flexible and modular architecture have been set, including
  parallelization of the circuit compilation and numerous optimizations


Compatibility Considerations
----------------------------

Please note that some backwards-incompatible changes have been introduced
during this release -- the following notes contain information on how to adapt
to the new changes.

Removal of ``QuantumProgram``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As hinted during the 0.5 release, the deprecation of the  ``QuantumProgram``
class has now been completed and is no longer available, in favor of working
with the individual components (:class:`~qiskit.backends.basejob.BaseJob`,
:class:`~qiskit._quantumcircuit.QuantumCircuit`,
:class:`~qiskit._classicalregister.ClassicalRegister`,
:class:`~qiskit._quantumregister.QuantumRegister`,
:mod:`~qiskit`) directly.

Please check the :ref:`0.5 release notes <quantum-program-0-5>` and the
examples for details about the transition::


  from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
  from qiskit import Aer, execute

  q = QuantumRegister(2)
  c = ClassicalRegister(2)
  qc = QuantumCircuit(q, c)

  qc.h(q[0])
  qc.cx(q[0], q[1])
  qc.measure(q, c)

  backend = get_backend('qasm_simulator')

  job_sim = execute(qc, backend)
  sim_result = job_sim.result()

  print("simulation: ", sim_result)
  print(sim_result.get_counts(qc))


IBM Q Authentication and ``Qconfig.py``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The managing of credentials for authenticating when using the IBM Q backends has
been expanded, and there are new options that can be used for convenience:

1. save your credentials in disk once, and automatically load them in future
   sessions. This provides a one-off mechanism::

     from qiskit import IBMQ
     IBQM.save_account('MY_API_TOKEN', 'MY_API_URL')

   afterwards, your credentials can be automatically loaded from disk by invoking
   :meth:`~qiskit.backends.ibmq.ibmqprovider.IBMQ.load_accounts`::

     from qiskit import IBMQ
     IBMQ.load_accounts()

   or you can load only specific accounts if you only want to use those in a session::

     IBMQ.load_accounts(project='MY_PROJECT')

2. use environment variables. If ``QE_TOKEN`` and ``QE_URL`` is set, the
   ``IBMQ.load_accounts()`` call will automatically load the credentials from
   them.

Additionally, the previous method of having a ``Qconfig.py`` file in the
program folder and passing the credentials explicitly is still supported.


.. _backends:

Working with backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new mechanism has been introduced in Terra 0.6 as the recommended way for
obtaining a backend, allowing for more powerful and unified filtering and
integrated with the new credentials system. The previous top-level methods
:meth:`~qiskit.wrapper._wrapper.register`,
:meth:`~qiskit.wrapper._wrapper.available_backends` and
:meth:`~qiskit.wrapper._wrapper.get_backend` are still supported, but will
deprecated in upcoming versions in favor of using the `qiskit.IBMQ` and
`qiskit.Aer` objects directly, which allow for more complex filtering.

For example, to list and use a local backend::

  from qiskit import Aer

  all_local_backends = Aer.backends(local=True)  # returns a list of instances
  qasm_simulator = Aer.backends('qasm_simulator')

And for listing and using remote backends::

  from qiskit import IBMQ

  IBMQ.enable_account('MY_API_TOKEN')
  5_qubit_devices = IBMQ.backends(simulator=True, n_qubits=5)
  ibmqx4 = IBMQ.get_backend('ibmqx4')

Please note as well that the names of the local simulators have been
simplified. The previous names can still be used, but it is encouraged to use
the new, shorter names:

=============================  ========================
Qiskit Terra 0.5               Qiskit Terra 0.6
=============================  ========================
'local_qasm_simulator'         'qasm_simulator'
'local_statevector_simulator'  'statevector_simulator'
'local_unitary_simulator_py'   'unitary_simulator'
=============================  ========================


Backend and Job API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Jobs submitted to IBM Q backends have improved capabilities. It is possible
  to cancel them and replenish credits (``job.cancel()``), and to retrieve
  previous jobs executed on a specific backend either by job id
  (``backend.retrieve_job(job_id)``) or in batch of latest jobs
  (``backend.jobs(limit)``)

* Properties for checking each individual job status (``queued``, ``running``,
  ``validating``, ``done`` and ``cancelled``) no longer exist. If you
  want to check the job status, use the identity comparison against
  ``job.status``::

    from qiskit.backends import JobStatus

    job = execute(circuit, backend)
    if job.status() is JobStatus.RUNNING:
        handle_job(job)

Please consult the new documentation of the
:class:`~qiskit.backends.ibmq.ibmqjob.IBMQJob` class to get further insight
in how to use the simplified API.

* A number of members of :class:`~qiskit.backends.basebackend.BaseBackend`
  and :class:`~qiskit.backends.basejob.BaseJob` are no longer properties,
  but methods, and as a result they need to be invoked as functions.

=====================  ========================
Qiskit Terra 0.5       Qiskit Terra 0.6
=====================  ========================
backend.name           backend.name()
backend.status         backend.status()
backend.configuration  backend.configuration()
backend.calibration    backend.properties()
backend.parameters     backend.jobs()
                       backend.retrieve_job(job_id)
job.status             job.status()
job.cancelled          job.queue_position()
job.running            job.cancel()
job.queued
job.done
=====================  ========================


Better Jupyter tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new release contains improvements to the user experience while using
Jupyter notebooks.

First, new interactive visualizations of counts histograms and quantum states
are provided:
:meth:`~qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_histogram` and
:meth:`~qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_state`.
These methods will default to the new interactive kind when the environment
is Jupyter and internet connection exists.

Secondly, the new release provides Jupyter cell magics for keeping track of
the progress of your code. Use ``%%qiskit_job_status`` to keep track of the
status of submitted jobs to IBM Q backends. Use ``%%qiskit_progress_bar`` to
keep track of the progress of compilation/execution.



**********
Qiskit 0.5
**********

Terra 0.5
=========

Highlights
----------

This release brings a number of improvements to Qiskit, both for the user
experience and under the hood. Please refer to the full changelog for a
detailed description of the changes - the highlights are:

* new ``statevector`` :mod:`simulators <qiskit.backends.local>` and feature and
  performance improvements to the existing ones (in particular to the C++
  simulator), along with a reorganization of how to work with backends focused
  on extensibility and flexibility (using aliases and backend providers)
* reorganization of the asynchronous features, providing a friendlier interface
  for running jobs asynchronously via :class:`Job` instances
* numerous improvements and fixes throughout the Terra as a whole, both for
  convenience of the users (such as allowing anonymous registers) and for
  enhanced functionality (such as improved plotting of circuits)


Compatibility Considerations
----------------------------

Please note that several backwards-incompatible changes have been introduced
during this release as a result of the ongoing development. While some of these
features will continue to be supported during a period of time before being
fully deprecated, it is recommended to update your programs in order to prepare
for the new versions and take advantage of the new functionality.

.. _quantum-program-0-5:


``QuantumProgram`` changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several methods of the :class:`~qiskit.QuantumProgram` class are on their way
to being deprecated:

* methods for interacting **with the backends and the API**:

  The recommended way for opening a connection to the IBM Q API and for using
  the backends is through the
  top-level functions directly instead of
  the ``QuantumProgram`` methods. In particular, the
  :func:`qiskit.register` method provides the equivalent of the previous
  :func:`qiskit.QuantumProgram.set_api` call. In a similar vein, there is a new
  :func:`qiskit.available_backends`, :func:`qiskit.get_backend` and related
  functions for querying the available backends directly. For example, the
  following snippet for version 0.4::

    from qiskit import QuantumProgram

    quantum_program = QuantumProgram()
    quantum_program.set_api(token, url)
    backends = quantum_program.available_backends()
    print(quantum_program.get_backend_status('ibmqx4')

  would be equivalent to the following snippet for version 0.5::

    from qiskit import register, available_backends, get_backend

    register(token, url)
    backends = available_backends()
    backend = get_backend('ibmqx4')
    print(backend.status)

* methods for **compiling and executing programs**:

  The :ref:`top-level functions <qiskit_top_level_functions>` now also provide
  equivalents for the :func:`qiskit.QuantumProgram.compile` and
  :func:`qiskit.QuantumProgram.execute` methods. For example, the following
  snippet from version 0.4::

    quantum_program.execute(circuit, args, ...)

  would be equivalent to the following snippet for version 0.5::

    from qiskit import execute

    execute(circuit, args, ...)

In general, from version 0.5 onwards we encourage to try to make use of the
individual objects and classes directly instead of relying on
``QuantumProgram``. For example, a :class:`~qiskit.QuantumCircuit` can be
instantiated and constructed by appending :class:`~qiskit.QuantumRegister`,
:class:`~qiskit.ClassicalRegister`, and gates directly. Please check the
update example in the Quickstart section, or the
``using_qiskit_core_level_0.py`` and ``using_qiskit_core_level_1.py``
examples on the main repository.

Backend name changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to provide a more extensible framework for backends, there have been
some design changes accordingly:

* **local simulator names**

  The names of the local simulators have been homogenized in order to follow
  the same pattern: ``PROVIDERNAME_TYPE_simulator_LANGUAGEORPROJECT`` -
  for example, the C++ simulator previously named ``local_qiskit_simulator``
  is now ``local_qasm_simulator_cpp``. An overview of the current
  simulators:

  * ``QASM`` simulator is supposed to be like an experiment. You apply a
    circuit on some qubits, and observe measurement results - and you repeat
    for many shots to get a histogram of counts via ``result.get_counts()``.
  * ``Statevector`` simulator is to get the full statevector (:math:`2^n`
    amplitudes) after evolving the zero state through the circuit, and can be
    obtained via ``result.get_statevector()``.
  * ``Unitary`` simulator is to get the unitary matrix equivalent of the
    circuit, returned via ``result.get_unitary()``.
  * In addition, you can get intermediate states from a simulator by applying
    a ``snapshot(slot)`` instruction at various spots in the circuit. This will
    save the current state of the simulator in a given slot, which can later
    be retrieved via ``result.get_snapshot(slot)``.

* **backend aliases**:

  The SDK now provides an "alias" system that allows for automatically using
  the most performant simulator of a specific type, if it is available in your
  system. For example, with the following snippet::

    from qiskit import get_backend

    backend = get_backend('local_statevector_simulator')

  the backend will be the C++ statevector simulator if available, falling
  back to the Python statevector simulator if not present.

More flexible names and parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several functions of the SDK have been made more flexible and user-friendly:

* **automatic circuit and register names**

  :class:`qiskit.ClassicalRegister`, :class:`qiskit.QuantumRegister` and
  :class:`qiskit.QuantumCircuit` can now be instantiated without explicitly
  giving them a name - a new autonaming feature will automatically assign them
  an identifier::

    q = QuantumRegister(2)

  Please note as well that the order of the parameters have been swapped
  ``QuantumRegister(size, name)``.

* **methods accepting names or instances**

  In combination with the autonaming changes, several methods such as
  :func:`qiskit.Result.get_data` now accept both names and instances for
  convenience. For example, when retrieving the results for a job that has a
  single circuit such as::

    qc = QuantumCircuit(..., name='my_circuit')
    job = execute(qc, ...)
    result = job.result()

  The following calls are equivalent::

    data = result.get_data('my_circuit')
    data = result.get_data(qc)
    data = result.get_data()
