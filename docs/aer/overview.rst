A high performance simulator framework for quantum circuits

Qiskit Aer provides a high performance simulator framework for the Qiskit software stack. It contains optimized C++ simulator backends for executing circuits compiled in Qiskit Terra, and tools for constructing highly configurable noise models for performing realistic noisy simulations of the errors that occur during execution on real devices.
