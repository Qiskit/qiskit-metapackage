Qiskit Aer provides a high performance simulator framework for quantum circuits using
the Qiskit software stack. It contains optimized C++ simulator backends for executing
circuits compiled in Qiskit Terra. Aer also provides tools for constructing highly
configurable noise models for performing realistic noisy simulations of the errors that
occur during execution on real devices.
