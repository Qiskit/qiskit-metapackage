Tomography
==========

Ignis has tools to perform state and process tomography on a given
Qiskit circuit (the outcome of the circuit for state tomography,
the circuit itself for process). Tomography attempts to reconstruct
the state (density matrix) or the process map (superoperator)
given the constraints of quantum measurements.
