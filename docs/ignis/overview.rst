Overview
========

A framework for characterizing quantum circuits and devices.

Qiskit ignis is a two-part framework. The first part is a set
of tools for generating characterization circuits that can
be run on quantum devices through terra (or simulators via aer).
The second part is a set of tools to analyze the results
after running these circuits. Ignis includes visualization tools
and data fitting to extract characterization parameters.
Some of these fit parameters can be used to calibrate
the results of algorithmic circuits.

Ignis Components
-----------------
- Randomized benchmarking
- Measurement calibration
- Tomography (state and process)
- Coherence characterization (T1,T2)
