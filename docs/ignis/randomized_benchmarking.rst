Randomized Benchmarking
==========================

Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a well-known technique to measure
average gate performance by running sequences of random Clifford gates
that should return the qubits to the initial state. Ignis has tools
to generate one- and two-qubit Clifford gate sequences simultaneously.

To use Qiskit Ignis randomized benchmarking (RB) module, import it with

.. code:: python

    import qiskit.ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking as rb

Generating RB Sequences
-----------------------

In order to generate the RB sequences **rb_circs**, which is a  list of lists of
quantum circuits, run

.. code:: python

    rb_circs, xdata = randomized_benchmarking_seq(nseeds, length_vector,
                                                  rb_pattern,
                                                  length_multiplier)

The parameters given to this function are:

- **nseeds:** The number of seeds. For each seed there you will get a separate list
  of output circuits in **rb_circs**.
- **length_vector**: The length vector of Clifford lengths. Must be in ascending order.
  RB sequences of increasing length grow on top of the previous sequences.
- **rb_pattern:** A list of the form [[i,j],[k],...] which will make simultaneous RB sequences
  where Qi,Qj are a 2-qubit RB sequence and Qk is a 1-qubit sequence, etc. The number of qubits
  is the sum of the entries. For 'regular' RB the qubit_pattern is just [[0]],[[0,1]].
- **length_multiplier:** If this is an array it scales each rb_sequence by the multiplier.

For example,

.. code:: python

    # Number of qubits
    nQ = 4
    # i.e., [Q0,Q1,Q2,Q3]

    # Number of seeds, which is the number of lists of RB sequences
    nseeds = 5

    # Number of Cliffords in each sequence (start, stop, steps)
    length_vector = np.arange(1,200,20)

    # Simultaneous 2-qubit RB on qubits Q0,Q2 and 1-qubit RB on qubits Q1 and Q3
    rb_pattern = [[0,2],[3],[1]]

    # Do three times as many 1Q Cliffords
    length_multiplier = [1,3,3]

This function returns:

- **rb_circs:** A list of lists of circuits for the rb sequences (separate list for each seed).
- **xdata:** The Clifford lengths (with multiplier if applicable).
- **rb_opts_dict:** Option dictionary back out with default options appended.


Analyzing Results
-----------------
Now, you can execute the randomized benchmarking either using
Qiskit Aer Simulator (with some noise model) or using IBMQ provider,
and obtain a list of results **result_list** for the RB sequences.


.. code:: python

    result_list = [] # Output results
    for rb_seed,rb_circ_seed in enumerate(rb_circs):
        print('Executing seed %d'%rb_seed)
        # Executing each RB sequence
        job = qiskit.execute(rb_circ_seed,
                            backend=backend, basis_gates=basis_gates,
                            shots=shots, noise_model=noise_model)
        result_list.append(job.result())

To get the statistics about the survival probabilities add the results
to a RB fitter.

.. code:: python

    rbfit = rb.RBFitter(result_list, xdata, rb_pattern)

where **results_list**, **xdata** and **rb_patterns** are as above.
The results can be added as a list or as one result. Results can be added
to an existing fitter as

.. code:: python

    rbfit.add_data(more_results)

The number of seeds in the fitter is based on the number of added
results. To compute the data, calculate the mean over seeds and fit the
results to an exponential curve (fit each of the RB patterns
**pattern_index**):

.. code:: python

    rbfit.calc_data()
    rbfit.calc_statistics()
    rbfit.fit_data()

These steps are performed automatically when data is added (unless rerun_fit
is set to False in add_data()). The fit parameters are:

.. code:: python

    # The three parameters (a, alpha, b) of the function a * alpha ** x + b.
    # The middle one is the exponent alpha.
    rbfit.fit[pattern_index]['parmas']
    # The error limits of the parameters.
    rbfit.fit[pattern_index]['err']
    # The error per Clifford
    rbfit.fit[pattern_index]['epc']
    # The error limit per Clifford
    rbfit.fit[pattern_index]['epc_err']

To plot the data plus fit, use

.. code:: python

    rbfit.plot_rb_data(pattern_index, ax=ax, add_label=True, show_plt=False)

where:

- **pattern_index:** Which RB pattern to plot.
- **ax (Axes or None):** Plot axis (if passed in).
- **add_label (bool):** Add an EPC label.
- **show_plt (bool):** Display the plot.


Predicted Results
-----------------

From the known depolarizing errors on the simulation you can
predict the fidelity. First you need to count the number
of gates per Clifford.

.. code:: python

    gates_per_cliff = rb.rb_utils.gates_per_clifford(qobj_list,
                                                     xdata[0],
                                                     basis_gates,
                                                     rb_opts['rb_pattern'][0])

Then you need to prepare lists of the number of qubits and the errors
and calculate the predicted error per clifford (epc):

.. code:: python

    pred_epc = rb.rb_utils.twoQ_clifford_error(ngates,gate_qubits,gate_errs)

where:

- **ngates:** A List of the number of gates per 2Q Clifford
- **gate_qubit:** A list of the qubit corresponding to the gate (0, 1 or -1).
  -1 corresponds to the 2Q gate.
- **gate_err:** list of the gate errors
