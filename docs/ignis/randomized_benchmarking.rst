Randomization Benchmarking
==========================

Randomization benchmarking (RB) is a well-known technique to measure
average gate performance by running sequences of random Clifford gates
that should return the qubits to the initial state. Ignis has tools
to generate one- and two-qubit Clifford gate sequences simultaneously.
