Community Extensions
====================

Qiskit has been designed with modularity in mind. It is extensible in many different ways and 
it is important to us to highlight the community projects

Backend Providers
-----------------

The Qiskit base provider is an entity that provides access to a group of different 
backends (for example, backends available through IBM Q). It interacts with 
those backends to do many things: find out which ones are available, retrieve
an instance of a particular backend, get backend properties and configurations,
and handling running and working with jobs.

Circuit Optimization 
--------------------

Circuit optimization is at the heart of making quantum computing. A central component of Qiskit is the transpiler, which is designed for modularity and extensibility. The goal is to be able to easily write new circuit transformations (known as transpiler passes) and combine them with other existing passes. In this way, the transpiler opens up the door for research into aggressive optimization of quantum circuits.

Tools
-----

Extending Qiskit with new tools and functionality is an important part of building a community. These tools can be new visualizations, slack integration, Juypter extensions and much more.
