The fundamental unit of Qiskit is the [**quantum circuit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit). A basic workflow using Qiskit consists of two stages: **Build** and **Execute**. **Build** allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving, and **Execute** that allows you to run them on different backends.  After the jobs have been run, the data is collected and postprocessed depending on the desired output."
