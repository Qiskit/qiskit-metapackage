    "# Adding measurements to `Schedule`s\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement is clearly a very important part of building a Pulse schedule -- this is required to get the results of our program execution! The powerful low-level control we are granted by Pulse gives us more freedom than `QuantumCircuit`s in specifying how the measurement should be done, enabling you to explore readout error mitigation. This power of course comes with responsibility: we have to understand how measurement works, and accomodate certain hardware constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this page, we will explore in depth how to create measurements, using several different approaches of increasing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Pulse allows you to receive raw, kerneled, and disciminated readout data (whereas circuits will only return discriminated data). Documentation for these options can be found here-COMING SOON.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a backend-default measurement with `measure`\n",
    "To add measurements as easily to `Schedule`s as to `QuantumCircuit`s, you just have to know which qubits you want to measure (below, qubits 0 and 1) and have a OpenPulse-enabled `backend`:\n",

    "### Basic measurement pattern and `measure_all`\n",
    "Let's use the default measurement feature to inspect a measurement and learn what each pulse does. Below, we use `measure_all`, which measures all the qubits on the backend."

    "Each qubit has two channels related to readout, as we see above. These are the readout transmit `MeasureChannel`s, and the readout receive `AcquireChannel`s. In superconducting qubit architectures, qubits are coupled to readout resonators. The `MeasureChannel` and `AcquireChannel`s label signal lines which connect to the readout resonator. The coupling between the qubit and the readout resonator hybridizes their state, so when a stimulus pulse is sent to the readout resonantor, the reflected pulse is dependent on the state of the qubit. The acquisition \"pulse\" is truly a trigger specifying to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to begin collecting data, and for how long. That data is used to classify the qubit state.\n",
