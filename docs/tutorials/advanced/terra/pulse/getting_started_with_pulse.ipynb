Most quantum algorithm can be described with circuits alone using gate operations -- typically, it's when you want to apply error mitigation techniques or characterize a time-dependent quality of a quantum system that pulse-level control becomes useful.\n",

The (zero-indexed) $i^{th}$ sample will play from time `i*dt` up to `(i + 1)*dt`, modulated by the qubit frequency.
