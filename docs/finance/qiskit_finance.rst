Qiskit Finance is a set of tools and algorithms
that enable experimenting with financial analysis and optimization problems
via quantum computing.

Qiskit Finance allows users with different levels of experience to execute financial analysis and
optimization experiments and contribute to the quantum computing finance software stack.
Users with a pure finance background or interests can continue to configure
financial analysis and optimization problems without having to learn the details of the
underlying quantum computing system.
Qiskit Finance uses the quantum algorithms offered by Qiskit Aqua
and allows to run everything on simulated or real quantum hardware through Qiskit Terra.

Qiskit Finance Problems
-----------------------

`Qiskit Finance <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/finance/qiskit_finance.ipynb>`__
can already be used to experiment with financial analysis and optimization problems,
such as

- option pricing,
- risk analysis, or
- portfolio management.

Contributing to Qiskit Finance
------------------------------

Research and developers interested in :ref:`aqua-extending` with new finance-specific
capabilities can take advantage
of the modular architecture of Aqua and easily extend Aqua with more algorithms
and algorithm components, such as new :ref:`oracles` for the :ref:`grover` algorithm,
:ref:`optimizers` and :ref:`variational-forms` for :ref:`vqe`, :ref:`qaoa`, and
:ref:`svm-variational`, :ref:`iqfts` for :ref:`qpe`, :ref:`initial-states` for
:ref:`variational-forms`, as well as :ref:`feature-maps` and :ref:`multiclass-extensions`
for Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, such as :ref:`svm-variational` and
:ref:`svm-q-kernel`.
