Transpiler Passes
=================

Circuit optimization is a difficult task (in general QMA-complete). Each
**transpiler pass** (circuit transformation) is responsible for doing one small,
well-defined task to make the overall task of circuit optimization tractable.

Circuits are internally represented by **directed acyclic graphs** (**DAGs**) in
Qiskit. Transpiler passes are transformations of a circuit's DAG representation.

There are two general classes of transpiler passes:

- ``AnalysisPass`` analyze a DAG and write
  conclusions to a common context, a ``PropertySet`` object. They cannot modify
  a DAG.
- ``TransformationPass`` can alter a DAG, but have read-only access to the
  property set.

Concrete transpiler passes derived from either of the classes above implement
the abstract method ``run()``, which takes and returns a DAG.

All of Qiskit's transpiler passes are accessible from
``qiskit.transpiler.passes``. Each pass is documented :py:mod:`here
<qiskit.transpiler.passes>`.
