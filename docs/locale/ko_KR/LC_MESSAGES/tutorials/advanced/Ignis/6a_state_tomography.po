msgid "Here we are going to generate and run the state tomography circuits. By only passing in the 2 registers we want to measure the state tomography will only run on that reduced :math:`2^2` Hilbert space. However, if we pass the whole register in the state tomography module will try and fit the full :math:`2^6` space."

The circuit is setup in such a way that after conditional tomography we will get a Bell state on the first two qubits."
