msgid "Building ``Schedule``\\ s is very straightforward, yet there are a few ways to compose them. We're going to explore these different methods here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:13
msgid "In this tutorial we use the ``Play`` instruction, with a ``ConstantPulse`` pulse argument. To learn about these and other ``Instruction``\\ s, first check out `this page <building_pulse_instructions.ipynb>`__."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:15
msgid "Tip: ``Instruction``\\ s can be treated just like ``Schedule``\\ s -- that means all the methods we use here work equally well for composing ``Schedule``\\ s with ``Schedule``\\ s, ``Instruction``\\ s with ``Instruction``\\ s, or between the two."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:17
msgid "As the basis for trying out the composition methods, let's initialize a couple dummy ``Schedule``\\ s."

msgid "``insert`` or ``|``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:38
msgid "The ``insert`` method schedules an ``Instruction`` or ``Schedule`` at a particular time. Let's use it to give each of our schedules a different instruction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:40
msgid "The insert schedule method overloads the ``|`` (or) operator for ``Schedule``\\ s, so we will use this special syntax on schedule ``B``. When using this syntactic sugar, the ``time`` argument is implicitly zero."
msgstr ""

msgid "``shift`` or ``<<``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:69
msgid "Sometimes we need to offset one schedule from ``time=0``. For instance, when using ``|``, we use ``shift`` to add an instruction at a time besides zero."

msgid "Let's see how we can use ``insert`` to compose schedules ``A`` and ``B`` together."

msgid "``append`` or ``+``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:124
msgid "The ``append`` method is like ``insert``, but the insertion time is determined for us. The ``Instruction`` or ``Schedule`` being added will begin when all the channels common to the two become free. If they contain no common channels, then the ``Schedule`` will be appended at ``time=0``. In psuedocode:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:132
msgid "The append schedule method overloads the ``+`` (add) operator for Schedules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:134
msgid "Let's continue with schedule ``A`` and schedule ``B``. Remember that they both have instructions scheduled on the same channel, ``DriveChannel(0)``. Schedule ``A`` contains positive amplitude pulses, and schedule ``B`` contains negative amplitude pulses."

msgid "Let's see what happens when there are no common channels."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:161
msgid "Warning: Common channels is not the same as common qubits. Measurements require different channels than gate operations, even on one qubit. If you simply append a measurement to a schedule, you'll likely schedule your measurement at ``time=0``, not what you were expecting! Instead, use the shift operation, with ``schedule.duration`` as the time argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:186
msgid "This time, the new instruction being appended was added at ``time=0``, because it did not have any instructions on ``DriveChannel(0)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:188
msgid "Be wary: ``append`` only \"slides\" the appended schedule into the original around channels that are not common between them. The following example demonstrates this point."
