msgid "**Randomization benchmarking (RB)** is a well-known technique to measure average gate performance by running sequences of random Clifford gates that should return the qubits to the initial state. Qiskit Ignis has tools to generate one- and two-qubit Clifford gate sequences simultaneously."

msgid "This notebook gives an example for how to use the ``ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking`` module. This particular example shows how to run 2-qubit randomized benchmarking (RB) simultaneous with 1-qubit RB. There are also examples on how to use some of the companion functions for predicting RB fidelity."
