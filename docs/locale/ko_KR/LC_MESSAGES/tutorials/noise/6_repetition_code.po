msgid "In quantum error correction we take many noisy qubits (which we call *physical qubits*) and use them to store a smaller number of *logical qubits*. The error correction procedure is designed to detect and correct for the effects of noise. This makes the logical qubits much less noisy and more reliable than the physical ones from which they are built."

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:25
msgid "The repetition code is a simple example of quantum error correction, in which a logical *bit* is stored rather than a logical *qubit*. A given instance of the repetition code is defined by two numbers, which we call :math:`d` and :math:`T`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:27
msgid "The :math:`d` parameter determines how many physical qubits are used. The actual information about the logical bit is stored in :math:`d` qubits (which we'll call *code qubits*). The encoding is done in a very simple way: to encode a ``0``, all these qubits are set in the state :math:`|0\\rangle`, to encode a ``1`` they are set to :math:`|1\\rangle`. To readout the value, you can just look at any qubit. To read it out in a way that protects against single qubit errors, you can read out all the qubits and take a majority vote."

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:32
msgid "Since this is an exercise in quantum error correction, we will do this in a way that would also work for logical *qubits*. Specifically, our method of extracting information about errors must not extract any information regarding the stored logical information. In the quantum case, this is required so that we do not disturb superposition states of the stored qubits."

msgid "We will extract information over :math:`T` rounds of *syndrome measurements*. For the repetition code, these are based on the fact that all code qubits should be in the same state (all :math:`|0\\rangle` or all :math:`|1\\rangle`). Any departure from this is therefore a signature of error. Specifically, we imagine our :math:`d` code qubits sitting along a line. We will then perform a measurement on each pair of neighboring code qubits. This will tell us whether they are the same or different, without extracting any information on what their values are."

msgid "The implementation of these measurements requires :math:`d-1` additional qubits, which we will call *link qubits* for the repetition code. By pefforming two CNOTs between the pair of code qubits and a corresponding link qubit, the required information (and only the required information) is placed on the link qubit and can then be measured."

Any code qubit could be used for this readout, since they should (without errors) all be equal. So we could have just one result here, for one arbitrarily chosen code qubit. Or we could have :math:`d`, one for each qubit. Instead we have two, from the two qubits at either end of the line. This is because it works best with the decoder (which we'll use later). In the absence of errors, these two values will always be equal."

msgid "The following ``0000`` is the :math:`d-1` results of the syndrome measurements for the first round.A ``0`` implies that the corresponding pair of qubits where the same, and ``1`` implies different.

msgid "Subsequent blocks follow the same formula, though the last requires some comment. This is not measured using the standard method (with a link qubit). Instead it is calculated from the final readout measurement of all code qubits. Again it is presented as a syndrome change, and will be all ``0`` in the absence of errors. This is the :math:`T+1`-th block of syndrome measurements since, as it is not done in the same way as the others, it is not counted among the :math:`T` syndrome measurement rounds."

msgid "**Example 1:** ``0 0  0110 0000 0000`` would represent a :math:`d=5`, :math:`T=2` repetition code with encoded ``0``. The syndrome shows that (most likely) the middle code qubit was flipped by an error before the first measurement round. This causes it to disagree with both neighboring code qubits for the rest of the circuit. This is shown by the syndrome in the first round, but the blocks for subsequent rounds do not report it as it no longer represents a change. Other sets of errors could also have caused this syndrome, but they would need to be more complex and so presumably less likely."

msgid "**Example 2:** ``0 0  0010 0010 0000`` would represent a :math:`d=5`, :math:`T=2` repetition code with encoded ``0``. Here one of the syndrome measurements reported a difference between two code qubits in the first round, leading to a ``1``. The next round did not see the same effect, and so resulted in a ``0``. However, since this disagreed with the previous result for the same syndrome measurement, and since we track syndrome changes, this change results in another ``1``. Subsequent rounds also do not detect anything, but this no longer represents a change and hence results in a ``0`` in the same position. Most likely the measurement result leading to the first ``1`` was an error."

msgid "**Example 3:** ``0 1  0000 0001 0000`` would represent a :math:`d=5`, :math:`T=2` repetition code with encoded ``1``. A code qubit on the end of the line is flipped before the second round of syndrome measurements. This is detected by only a single syndrome measurement, because it is on the end of the line. For the same reason, it also disturbs one of the logical readouts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:1141
msgid "Note that in all these examples, a single error causes exactly two characters in the string to change from the value it would have with no errors. This is, in fact, the reason why the logical output consists of both endpoints. It is a property that will be used by the decoder."

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:1471
msgid "Noisy results can change the logical value at readout, and so affect our ability to read out the logical qubit. This can be mitigated by looking at the syndrome values. These can tell us whether or not the logical values are most likely to have changed, and so allow us to correct for the errors. The process of analyzing the syndrome to correct for the errors is called 'decoding'. We do this by building a decoding object for our code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:1492

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:1494
msgid "For example, let's use the 'matching' algorithm to decode, which is based on minimum weight perfect matching. This takes specific output strings as input. We'll give it the simple example string ``'1 0  001 100 100'``, for a logical ``1`` that has suffered two errors."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/noise/6_repetition_code.ipynb:1546
msgid "When we take many samples, we can determine the probability with which the decoder is incorrect. This should decrease exponentially as the code size is increased, since the configurations of noise that fool the decoder become less likely. The probability of a logical error is calculated using the ``logical_prob()`` method. This runs matching by default, but other algorithms can be specified by the ``algorithm`` kwarg."
