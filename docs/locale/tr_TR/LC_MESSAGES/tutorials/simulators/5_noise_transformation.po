msgid "This notebook shows how to use the Qiskit Aer utility functions ``approximate_quantum_error`` and ``approximate_noise_model`` to transform quantum noise channels into a different, more suitable, noise channel."

msgid "Our guiding example is Clifford simulation. A Clifford simulator can efficiently simulate quantum computations which include gates only from a limited, non-universal set of gates (the Clifford gates). Not all quantum noises can be added to such simulations; hence, we aim to find a \"close\" noise channel which can be simulated in a Clifford simulator."
