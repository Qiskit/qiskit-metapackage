For now we will assume all the other circuit instructions are ideal."

msgid "Note that when we add an error to a custom label such as ``\"iswap\"`` the ``NoiseModel`` does not know what gate this label is supposed to apply to, so we must manually add the desired gate string to the noise model ``basis_gates``. This ensures that the compiler will unroll to the correct basis gates for the noise model simulation. This can done using the ``NoiseModel.add_basis_gates`` function:"
