msgid "You can access the constant, the linear term, and the quadratic term by looking at ``Quadratic.objective.{constant, linear, quadratic}``, respectively. As for linear and quadratic terms, you can get a dense matrix (``to_array``), a sparse matrix (``coefficients``), and a dictionary (``to_dict``). For dictionaries, you can specify whether to use variable indices or names as keys. Note that the quadratic terms are stored in a compressed way, e.g., ``{('x', 'y'): 1, ('y', 'x'): 2}`` is stored as ``{('x', 'y'): 3}``. You can get the quadratic term as a symmetric matrix by calling ``to_array(symmetric=True)`` or ``to_dict(symmetric=True)``. If you call ``to_dict(name=True)``, you can get a dictionary whose keys are pairs of variable names."
