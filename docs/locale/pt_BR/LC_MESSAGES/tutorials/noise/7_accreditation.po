msgid "Given a noisy quantum device implementing a \"target\" quantum circuit, AP certifies an upper-bound on the variation distance between the probability distribution of the outputs returned by the device and the ideal probability distribution. This method is based on Ferracin et al, \"Accrediting outputs of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices\", https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09709."

The accreditation is made by employing **trap circuits**, circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and that whose outputs are used to witness the correct functionality of the device."
