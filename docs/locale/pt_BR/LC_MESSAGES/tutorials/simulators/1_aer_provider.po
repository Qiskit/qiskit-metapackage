msgid "Qiskit Aer currently includes three high performance simulator backends: \\* ``QasmSimulator``: Allows ideal and noisy multi-shot execution of qiskit circuits and returns counts or memory \\* ``StatevectorSimulator``: Allows ideal single-shot execution of qiskit circuits and returns the final statevector of the simulator after application \\* ``UnitarySimulator``: Allows ideal single-shot execution of qiskit circuits and returns the final unitary matrix of the circuit itself. Note that the circuit cannot contain measure or reset operations for this backend"
