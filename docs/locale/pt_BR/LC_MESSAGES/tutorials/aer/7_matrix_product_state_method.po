msgid "The ``QasmSimulator`` has several simulation methods including ``statevector``, ``stabilizer``, ``extended_stabilizer`` and ``matrix_product_state``. Each of these determines the internal representation of the quantum circuit and the algorithms used to process the quantum operations. They each have advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the best method is a matter of investigation. In this tutorial, we focus on the ``matrix product state simulation method``."

msgid "This simulation method is based on the concept of ``matrix product states``. This structure was initially proposed in the paper *Efficient classical simulation of slightly entangled quantum computations* by Vidal in https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301063. There are additional papers that describe the structure in more detail, for example *The density-matrix renormalization group in the age of matrix product states* by Schollwoeck https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3477."

msgid "The matrix product state (MPS) representation offers a local representation, in the form: :math:`\\Gamma^{[1]} \\lambda^{[1]} \\Gamma^{[2]} \\lambda^{[2]}\\ldots \\Gamma^{[1]} \\lambda^{[n-1]} \\Gamma^{[n]}`, such that all the information contained in the :math:`c_{i_1 \\ldots i_n}`, can be generated out of the MPS representation."

msgid "Two-qubit gates operate on consecutive qubits :math:`i` and :math:`i+1`. This involves a tensor-contract operation over :math:`\\lambda^{[i-1]}`, :math:`\\Gamma^{[i-1]}`, :math:`\\lambda^{[i]}`, :math:`\\Gamma^{[i+1]}` and :math:`\\lambda^{[i+1]}`, that creates a single tensor. We apply the gate to this tensor, and then decompose back to the original structure. This operation may increase the size of the respective tensors. Gates that involve two qubits that are not consecutive, require a series of swap gates to bring the two qubits next to each other and then the reverse swaps."

msgid "In the worst case, the tensors may grow exponentially. However, the size of the overall structure remains 'small' for circuits that do not have 'many' two-qubit gates. This allows much more efficient operations in circuits with relatively 'low' entanglement. Characterizing when to use this method over other methods is a subject of current research."

msgid "Running circuits using the matrix product state simulation method can be fast, relative to other methods. However, if we generate the state vector during the execution, then the conversion to state vector is, of course, exponential in memory and time, and therefore we don't benefit from using this method. We can benefit if we only do operations that don't require printing the full state vector. For example, if we run a circuit and then take measurement. The circuit below has 200 qubits. We create an ``EPR state`` involving all these qubits. Although this state is highly entangled, it is handled well by the matrix product state method, because there are effectively only two states."
