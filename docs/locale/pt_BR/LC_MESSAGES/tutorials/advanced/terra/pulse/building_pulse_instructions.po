msgid "The image below may provide some intuition for why they are specified separately. Think of the pulses which describe their envelopes as input to an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), a common lab instrument -- this is depicted in the left image. Notice the limited sample rate discritizes the signal. The signal produced by the AWG may be mixed with a continuous sine wave generator. The frequency of its output is controlled by instructions to the sine wave generator; see the middle image. Finally, the signal sent to the qubit is demonstrated by the right side of the image below."

A parametric pulse sends the name of the function and its parameters to the backend, rather than every individual sample. Using parametric pulses makes the jobs you send to the backend much smaller. IBM Quantum backends limit the maximum job size that they accept, so parametric pulses may allow you to run larger programs."
