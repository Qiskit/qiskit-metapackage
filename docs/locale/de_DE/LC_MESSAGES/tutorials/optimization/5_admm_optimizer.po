We first solve the problem classically: we use the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` with the ``NumPyMinimumEigenSolver`` as a classical and exact QUBO solver and we use the ``CobylaOptimizer`` as a continuous convex solver. 3-ADMM-H supports any other suitable solver available in Qiskit. For instance, VQE, QAOA, and GroverOptimizer can be invoked as quantum solvers, as demonstrated later. If CPLEX is installed, the ``CplexOptimizer`` can also be used as both, a QUBO and convex solver."

The penalization ``factor_c`` of equality constraints :math:`Gx = b` is set to :math:`900`. The tolerance ``tol`` for primal residual convergence is set to ``1.e-6``. In this case, the 3-block implementation is guaranteed to converge for Theorem 4 of [1], because the inequality constraint with the continuous variable is always active. The 2-block implementation can be run by setting ``three_block=False``, and practically converges to a feasible not optimal solution."
