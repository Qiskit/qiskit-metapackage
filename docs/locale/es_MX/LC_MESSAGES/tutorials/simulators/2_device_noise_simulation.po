msgid "Note, that these automatic models are only an *approximation* of the real errors that occur on actual devices, due to the fact that they must be build from a limited set of input parameters related to *average error rates* on gates. The study of quantum errors on real devices is an active area of research and we discuss the Qiskit Aer tools for configuring more detailed noise models in another notebook."
