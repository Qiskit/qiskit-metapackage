msgstr ""

msgid "Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication."

msgid "Qiskit Terra is organized in six main modules:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:25
msgid "`Circuit <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit.html>`__ A quantum circuit is a model for quantum computing in which a computation is done by performing a sequence of quantum operations (usually gates) on a register of qubits. A quantum circuit usually starts with the qubits in the :math:`|0,…,0>` state and these gates evolve the qubits to states that cannot be efficiently represented on a classical computer. To extract information on the state a quantum circuit must have a measurement which maps the outcomes (possible random due to the fundamental nature of quantum systems) to classical registers which can be efficiently represented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:34
msgid "`Pulse <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html>`__ A pulse schedule is set of pulses which are sent to a quantum experiment that are applied to a channel (experimental input line). This is a lower level than circuits and requires each gate in the circuit to be  represented as a set of pulses. At this level the experiments can be designed to reduce errors (dynamical decoupling, error mitigation, and optimal pulse shapes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:40
msgid "`Transpiler <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/transpiler.html>`__ A major part of research on quantum computing is working out how to run a quantum circuits on real devices.  In these devices, experimental errors and decoherence introduce errors during computation. Thus, to obtain a robust implementation it is essential to reduce the number of gates and the overall running time of the quantum circuit. The transpiler introduces the concept of a pass manager to allow users to explore optimization and find better quantum circuits for their given algorithm. We call it a transpiler as the end result is still a circuit."

#: ../../the_elements.rst:49
msgid "`Providers <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/providers.html>`__ Once the user has made the circuits to run on the backend they need to have a convenient way of working with it. In Terra we do this using four parts:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:53
msgid "A `Provider <https://qiskit.org/documentation/api/qiskit.providers.BaseProvider.html>`__ is an entity that provides access to a group of different backends (for example, backends available through the `IBM Quantum Experience <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com>`__). It interacts with those backends to, for example, find out which ones are available, or retrieve an instance of a particular backend."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:59
msgid "`Backend <https://qiskit.org/documentation/api/qiskit.providers.BaseBackend.html>`__ represent either a simulator or a real quantum computer and are responsible for running quantum circuits and returning results. They have a run method which takes in a `qobj` as input and returns a `BaseJob` object. This object allows asynchronous running of jobs for retrieving results from a backend when the job is completed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:65
msgid "`Job <https://qiskit.org/documentation/api/qiskit.providers.BaseJob.html>`__ instances can be thought of as the “ticket” for a submitted job. They find out the execution’s state at a given point in time (for example, if the job is queued, running, or has failed) and also allow control over the job."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:70
msgid "`Result <https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.result.Result.html>`__. Once the job has finished Terra allows the results to be obtained from the remote backends using `result = job.result()`. This result object holds the quantum data and the most common way of interacting with it is by using `result.get_counts(circuit)`. This method allows the user to get the raw counts from the quantum circuit and use them for more analysis with quantum information tools provided by Terra."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:78
msgid "`Quantum Information <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/quantum_info.html>`__ To perform more advanced algorithms and analysis of the circuits run on the quantum computer, it is important to have tools to implement simple quantum information tasks. These include methods to both estimate metrics and generate quantum states, operations, and channels."
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:84
msgid "`Visualization <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/visualization.html>`__ In Terra we have many tools to visualize a quantum circuit. This allows a quick inspection of the quantum circuit to make sure it is what the user wanted to implement. There is a text, python and latex version. Once the circuit has run it is important to be able to view the output. There is a simple function (`plot_histogram`) to plot the results from a quantum circuit including an interactive version. There is also a function `plot_state` and `plot_bloch_vector` that allow the plotting of a quantum state. These functions are usually only used when using the `statevector_simulator` backend but can also be used on real data after running state tomography experiments (Ignis)."

msgid "Aer"
msgstr ""

#: ../../the_elements.rst:100
msgid "Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers we need better simulators, emulators and debuggers. Aer helps us understand the limits of classical processors by demonstrating to what extent they can mimic quantum computation. Furthermore, we can use Aer to verify that current and near-future quantum computers function correctly. This can be done by stretching the limits of simulation, and by simulating the effects of realistic noise on the computation."
