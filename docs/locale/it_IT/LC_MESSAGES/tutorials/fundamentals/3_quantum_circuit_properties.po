msgid "When constructing quantum circuits, there are several properties that help quantify the \"size\" of the circuits, and their ability to be run on a noisy quantum device. Some of these, like number of qubits, are straightforward to understand, while others like depth and number of tensor components require a bit more explanation. Here we will explain all of these properties, and, in preparation for understanding how circuits change when run on actual devices, highlight the conditions under which they change."

Because we can do single-qubit gates on all the qubits simultaneously, the number of qubits in this circuit is equal to the **width** of the circuit:"

msgid "Warning: For a quantum circuit composed from just qubits, the circuit width is equal to the number of qubits. This is the definition used in quantum computing. However, for more complicated circuits with classical registers, and classically controlled gates, this equivalence breaks down. As such, from now on we will not refer to the number of qubits in a quantum circuit as the width."

msgid "A particularly important circuit property is known as the **depth**. The depth of a quantum circuit is a measure of how many \"layers\" of quantum gates, executed in parallel, it takes to complete the computation defined by the circuit. Because quantum gates take time to implement, the depth of a circuit roughly corresponds to the amount of time it takes the quantum computer to execute the circuit. Thus, the depth of a circuit is one important quantity used to measure if a quantum circuit can be run on a device."

msgid "The depth of a quantum circuit has a mathematical definition as the longest path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, such a definition is a bit hard to grasp, even for experts. Fortunately, the depth of a circuit can be easily understood by anyone familiar with playing `Tetris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris>`__. To understand this, let us redraw the circuit with the first five CNOT gates colored differently for clarity:"

Later gates stack on earlier gates, and multi-qubit gate components must be stacked at the same height. For the current circuit of interest, this stacking looks like:"

The remaining gates stack on top of the CNOT layer as shown. The stack of gates can be partitioned into \"layers\", where each layer represents a set of gates that can be executed in parallel on a quantum device (Hardware limitations may restrict the number and/or type of gates that can be run in parallel). The **depth** of the circuit is just the number of layers in the circuit; The depth is equal to the height of the stack of gates. This computation is done for you in qiskit, and we can verify our visual method:"

msgid "In the limit where only single-qubit gates are performed, it should be clear that each qubit is controlled independently of the rest, and thus we can run each qubit independently and still get the desired result. Thus, the question becomes are there enough entangling gates in the circuit to have all qubits interacting? Again, this is best understood in terms of diagrams. Below, we track the sets of qubits that interact amongst themselves via CNOT gates at each layer in the circuit."

Fortunately, often times one can reduce this overhead through smart circuit rewriting toolchains."
