"**A:** Please cite Qiskit by using the included `BibTeX file "
"<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qiskit/qiskit/master/Qiskit.bib>`__."

"**Q: Why do I receive the error message** ``Error: Instance of "
"QuantumCircuit has no member`` **when adding gates to a circuit?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:17
msgid ""
"**A:** This is a pylint error, which is a Linter for Python. Linters "
"analyze code for potential errors, and they throw errors when they find "
"potentially erroneous code. However, this error should not prevent your "
"code from compiling or running, so there is no need to worry. The error "
"message can be disabled by adding the following line above the code that "
"is causing the error:"

"**Q: Why do my results from real devices differ from my results from the "
"simulator?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:32
msgid ""
"**A:** The simulator runs jobs as though is was in an ideal environment; "
"one without noise or decoherence. However, when jobs are run on the real "
"devices there is noise from the environment and decoherence, which causes"
" the qubits to behave differently than what is intended."

"**Q: Why do I receive the error message,** ``No Module 'qiskit'`` **when "
"using Jupyter Notebook?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:41
msgid ""
"**A:** If you used ``pip install qiskit`` and set up your virtual "
"environment in Anaconda, then you may experience this error when you run "
"a tutorial in Jupyter Notebook. If you have not installed Qiskit or set "
"up your virtual environment, you can follow the `installation steps "
"<https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install>`__."

#: ../../faq.rst:47
msgid ""
"The error is caused when trying to import the Qiskit package in an "
"environment where Qiskit is not installed. If you launched Jupyter "
"Notebook from the Anaconda-Navigator, it is possible that Jupyter "
"Notebook is running in the base (root) environment, instead of in your "
"virtual environment. Choose a virtual environment in the Anaconda-"
"Navigator from the **Applications on** dropdown menu. In this menu, you "
"can see all of the virtual environments within Anaconda, and you can "
"select the environment where you have Qiskit installed to launch Jupyter "
"Notebook."

msgid "**Q: Why am I getting a compilation error while installing ``qiskit``?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:61
msgid ""
"**A:** Qiskit depends on a number of other open source Python packages, "
"which are automatically installed when doing ``pip install qiskit``. "
"Depending on your system's platform and Python version, is it possible "
"that a particular package does not provide a pre-built binary wheel for "
"your system, and in those cases ``pip`` will attempt to compile the "
"package from source, which in turn might require some extra dependencies "
"that need to be installed manually."
