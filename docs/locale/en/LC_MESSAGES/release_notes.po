"The 0.9 release includes many new features and many bug fixes. The "
"biggest changes for this release are new debugging capabilities for "
"PassManagers. This includes a function to visualize a PassManager, the "
"ability to add a callback function to a PassManager, and logging of "
"passes run in the PassManager. Additionally, this release standardizes "
"the way that you can set an initial layout for your circuit. So now you "
"can leverage ``initial_layout`` the kwarg parameter on "
"``qiskit.compiler.transpile()`` and ``qiskit.execute()`` and the qubits "
"in the circuit will get laid out on the desire qubits on the device. "
"Visualization of circuits will now also show this clearly when "
"visualizing a circuit that has been transpiled with a layout."
