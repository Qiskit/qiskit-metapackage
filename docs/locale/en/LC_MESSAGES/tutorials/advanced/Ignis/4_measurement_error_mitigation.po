"The measurement calibration is used to mitigate measurement errors. The "
"main idea is to prepare all :math:`2^n` basis input states and compute "
"the probability of measuring counts in the other basis states. From these"
" calibrations, it is possible to correct the average results of another "
"experiment of interest. This notebook gives examples for how to use the "
