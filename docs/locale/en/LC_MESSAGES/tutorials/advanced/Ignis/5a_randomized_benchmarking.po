"**Randomization benchmarking (RB)** is a well-known technique to measure "
"average gate performance by running sequences of random Clifford gates "
"that should return the qubits to the initial state. Qiskit Ignis has "
"tools to generate one- and two-qubit Clifford gate sequences "
"simultaneously."

"``ignis.verification.randomized_benchmarking`` module. This particular "
"example shows how to run 2-qubit randomized benchmarking (RB) "
"simultaneous with 1-qubit RB. There are also examples on how to use some "
"of the companion functions for predicting RB fidelity."
