"**Purity Randomized Benchmarking** is a variant of the Randomized "
"Benchmarking (RB) method, which quantifies how *coherent* the errors are."
" The protocol executes the RB sequences containing Clifford gates, and "
"then calculates the *purity* :math:`Tr(\\rho^2)`, and fits the purity "
"result to an exponentially decaying curve."
