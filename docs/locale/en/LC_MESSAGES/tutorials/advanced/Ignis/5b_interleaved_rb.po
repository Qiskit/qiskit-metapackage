"**Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking** is a variant of the Randomized "
"Benchmarking (RB) method that is used for benchmarking individual "
"Clifford gates via randomization. The protocol consists of interleaving "
"random gates between the given Clifford gate of interest. The protocol "
"estimates the gate error of the given Clifford. The method is based on "
"the paper *\"Efficient measurement of quantum gate error by interleaved "
"randomized benchmarking\"*\\ (https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4550)."
