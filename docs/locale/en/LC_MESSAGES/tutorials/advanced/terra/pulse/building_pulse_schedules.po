"Building ``Schedule``\\ s is very straightforward, yet there are a few "
"ways to compose them. We're going to explore these different methods "
"here."

msgid ""
"Tip: ``Instruction``\\ s can be treated just like ``Schedule``\\ s -- "
"that means all the methods we use here work equally well for composing "
"``Schedule``\\ s with ``Schedule``\\ s, ``Instruction``\\ s with "
"``Instruction``\\ s, or between the two."

"As the basis for trying out the composition methods, let's initialize a "
"couple dummy ``Schedule``\\ s."

"The ``insert`` method schedules an ``Instruction`` or ``Schedule`` at a "
"particular time. Let's use it to give each of our schedules a different "
"instruction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:38
msgid ""
"The insert schedule method overloads the ``|`` (or) operator for "
"``Schedule``\\ s, so we will use this special syntax on schedule ``B``. "
"When using this syntactic sugar, the ``time`` argument is implicitly "
"zero."

msgid "``shift`` or ``<<``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:93
msgid ""
"Sometimes we need to offset one schedule from ``time=0``. For instance, "
"when using ``|``, we use ``shift`` to add an instruction at a time "
"besides zero."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:174
msgid ""
"The ``append`` method is like ``insert``, but the insertion time is "
"determined for us. The ``Instruction`` or ``Schedule`` being added will "
"begin when all the channels common to the two become free. If they "
"contain no common channels, then the ``Schedule`` will be appended at "
"``time=0``. In psuedocode:"

"The append schedule method overloads the ``+`` (add) operator for "
"Schedules."

msgid ""
"Let's continue with schedule ``A`` and schedule ``B``. Remember that they"
" both have instructions scheduled on the same channel, "
"``DriveChannel(0)``. Schedule ``A`` contains positive amplitude pulses, "
"and schedule ``B`` contains negative amplitude pulses."

msgid ""
"Warning: Common channels is not the same as common qubits. Measurements "
"require different channels than gate operations, even on one qubit. If "
"you simply append a measurement to a schedule, you'll likely schedule "
"your measurement at ``time=0``, not what you were expecting! Instead, use"
" the shift operation, with ``schedule.duration`` as the time argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:258
msgid ""
"This time, the new instruction being appended was added at ``time=0``, "
"because it did not have any instructions on ``DriveChannel(0)``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/building_pulse_schedules.ipynb:260
msgid ""
"Be wary: ``append`` only \"slides\" the appended schedule into the "
"original around channels that are not common between them. The following "
"example demonstrates this point."
