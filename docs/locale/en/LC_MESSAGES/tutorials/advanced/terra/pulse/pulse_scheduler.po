"The scheduler will translate a ``QuantumCircuit`` into a Pulse "

"pulse-level description of an operation on particular qubits."

"Backends that are OpenPulse enabled will typically have calibrations "

"We'll use the mocked backend, ``FakeAlmaden``, to demonstrate how to use "
"the scheduler. It contains default calibrations for measurement and for "
"its basis gates. The Hadamard operation is not one of those basis gates, "
"so we use the transpiler to compile our input circuit to an equivalent "
"circuit in terms of the basis gates of the device."

"Let's see how our schedule ``schedule`` built from the circuit "

"That covers the basics! We used the transpiler to rewrite the circuit in "

"calibrations to schedule the transpiled circuit. Next we will go through "

"Using the scheduler with Pulse, we are not restrained by the basis gates "

" gate on qubit 0, which is used by our Bell state circuit. Our Hadamard "
"will be a Gaussian pulse. In practice, the pulse shape and its parameters"
" would be optimized through a series of Rabi experiments (see the `Qiskit"

"The scheduler can follow multiple routines. By default, it follows an *as"
" late as possible* (ALAP) rule. Another scheduling method is *as soon as "
"possible*, (ASAP). For both methods, the output schedule is minimal: in "
"the longest-duration operation path of the input circuit, the start time "
"of each operation is the end time of the proceeding operation. The "
"methods determine how to schedule operations outside that longest path."

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/pulse_scheduler.ipynb:482
msgid ""
"For our mocked backend, these :math:`X` gate operations are each the same"
" duration (``duration = 160 dt``). For the schedule to be minimal, the "
"two :math:`X` operations on qubit 0 will be scheduled back-to-back, and "
"the measurement pulse will immediately follow the second of those pulses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/pulse_scheduler.ipynb:484
msgid ""
"ALAP will choose the latest valid time to schedule lesser-constrained "
"operations, so the :math:`X` gate on qubit 1 will play in sync with the "
"second :math:`X` gate on qubit 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/pulse_scheduler.ipynb:509
msgid ""
"On the other hand, as the name suggests, ASAP will schedule operations as"
" soon as its resources are free. Thus, the :math:`X` gate on qubit 1 will"
" be scheduled at ``time=0``, in sync with the first :math:`X` gate on "
"qubit 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/pulse_scheduler.ipynb:534
msgid ""
"ALAP is the default because it allows qubits to remain idle as long as "
"possible. In this case, the difference between ALAP and ASAP may be "
"negligible, but in ALAP, qubit 0 has *no* time to decay from the excited "
"state before measurement."
