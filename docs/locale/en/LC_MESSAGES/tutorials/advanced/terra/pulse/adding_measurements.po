"Measurement is clearly a very important part of building a Pulse schedule"
" -- this is required to get the results of our program execution! The "
"powerful low-level control we are granted by Pulse gives us more freedom "
"than ``QuantumCircuit``\\ s in specifying how the measurement should be "
"done, enabling you to explore readout error mitigation. This power of "
"course comes with responsibility: we have to understand how measurement "
"works, and accomodate certain hardware constraints."

msgid ""
"To add measurements as easily to ``Schedule``\\ s as to "
"``QuantumCircuit``\\ s, you just have to know which qubits you want to "
"measure (below, qubits 0 and 1) and have a OpenPulse-enabled ``backend``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/adding_measurements.ipynb:28

"The ``backend`` contains a default definition for measurement, which is "
"tailored to the qubits you are measuring."

"Let's use the default measurement feature to inspect a measurement and "
"learn what each pulse does. Below, we use ``measure_all``, which measures"
" all the qubits on the backend."

"Each qubit has two channels related to readout, as we see above. These "
"are the readout transmit ``MeasureChannel``\\ s, and the readout receive "
"``AcquireChannel``\\ s. In superconducting qubit architectures, qubits "
"are coupled to readout resonators. The ``MeasureChannel`` and "
"``AcquireChannel``\\ s label signal lines which connect to the readout "
"resonator. The coupling between the qubit and the readout resonator "
"hybridizes their state, so when a stimulus pulse is sent to the readout "
"resonantor, the reflected pulse is dependent on the state of the qubit. "
"The acquisition \"pulse\" is truly a trigger specifying to the analog-to-"
"digital converter (ADC) to begin collecting data, and for how long. That "
"data is used to classify the qubit state."

"If you would like to specify where your measurement results go, there is "
"an option for that in ``measure``, called ``qubit_mem_slots``. It takes a"
" dictionary mapping qubit indices to classical memory slots. For example,"

"Due to control rack hardware constraints, some qubits may need to be "

"Getting back to our example, let's imagine we plan to run on a backend "
