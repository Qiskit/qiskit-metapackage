"Qiskit Pulse programs give you more control than ``QuantumCircuit``. At "
"this level, you can specify the exact time dynamics of the input signals "
"across all input channels. Most quantum algorithm can be described with "
"circuits alone using gate operations -- typically, it's when you want to "
"apply error mitigation techniques or characterize a time-dependent "
"quality of a quantum system that pulse-level control becomes useful."

"Perhaps the most central instruction for building schedules is the "
"``SamplePulse``. It is a pulse signal specified as an array of time-"
"ordered complex amplitudes, or *samples*. Each sample is played for one "
"cycle, a timestep ``dt``, determined by the backend. If we want to know "
"the real-time dynamics of our program, we need to know the value of "
"``dt``. For now, let's focus on how to build the instruction."

"There are multiple ways to build pulses, which you can learn about on "
"later pages. This time, we've simply passed the exact amplitudes of the "
"pulse envelope we want to play as an array. The array above is a Gaussian"
" function evaluated at 64 points, with an amplitude of 1 and a standard "
"deviation of 8. The (zero-indexed) :math:`i^{th}` sample will play from "
"time ``i*dt`` up to ``(i + 1)*dt``, modulated by the qubit frequency. "
"Think of this like an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), playing the "
"samples you give to the ``SamplePulse``, mixed with a continuous sine "
"wave generator outputting a tone at the qubit frequency."

"The values above happen to be real, but they can also be complex. The "
"amplitude norm of any pulse signal is arbitrarily limited to 1. Each "
"backend system may also impose further constraints -- for instance, a "
"minimum pulse size of 64. Learn more about getting information from the "

"Next, we have to schedule the pulse signal we just built. This means "
"specifying not only the *time* that the pulse should be played, but also "
"*where* it should be played. When we build circuits, we specify which "

"multiple *channels*."

"This pulse will drive qubit 0. It is modulated at qubit 0's resonant "
