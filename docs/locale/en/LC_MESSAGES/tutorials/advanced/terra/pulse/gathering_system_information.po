"Programming a quantum computer at the microwave pulse level requires more"
" information about the device than is required at the circuit level. A "
"quantum circuit is built for an abstract quantum computer -- it will "
"yield the same quantum state on any quantum computer (except for varying "
"performance levels). A pulse schedule, on the other hand, is so specific "
"to the device, that running one program on two different backends is not "
"expected to have the same result, even on perfectly noiseless systems."

"As a basic example, imagine a drive pulse ``q0_X180`` calibrated on qubit"
" 0 to enact an :math:`X180` pulse, which flips the state of qubit 0. If "
"we use the samples from that pulse on qubit 1 on the same device, or "
"qubit 0 on another device, we do not know what the resulting state will "
"be -- but we can be pretty sure it won't be an :math:`X180` operation. "
"The qubits are each unique, with various drive coupling strengths. If we "
"have specified a frequency for the drive pulse, it's very probable that "
"pulse would have little effect on another qubit, which has its own "
"resonant frequency."

"With that, we have motivated why information from the backend may be very"
" useful at times for building Pulse schedules. The information included "
