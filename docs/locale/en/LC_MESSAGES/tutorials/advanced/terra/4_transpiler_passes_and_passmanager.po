"A central component of Qiskit Terra is the transpiler, which is designed "
"for modularity and extensibility. The goal is to be able to easily write "
"new circuit transformations (known as transpiler **passes**), and combine"
" them with other existing passes. Which passes are chained together and "
"in which order has a major effect on the final outcome. This pipeline is "
"determined by a **pass manager**, which schedules the passes and also "
"allows passes to communicate with each other by providing a shared space."
" In this way, the transpiler opens up the door for research into "
"aggressive optimization of quantum circuits."

"In this notebook, we look at the built-in passes, how to use the pass "
"manager, and develop a simple custom transpiler pass. In order to do the "
"latter, we first need to introduce the internal representation of quantum"
" circuits in Qiskit, in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph, or **DAG**."
" Then, we illustrate a simple swap mapper pass, which transforms an input"
" circuit to be compatible with a limited-connectivity quantum device."

"In Qiskit, we represent circuits internally using a Directed Acyclic "
"Graph (DAG). The advantage of this representation over a pure list of "
"gates (i.e., *netlist*) is that the flow of information between "
"operations are explicit, making it easier for passes to make "
"transformation decisions without changing the semantics of the circuit."

"The first thing to do when writing a transpiler pass is to decide whether"
" the pass class derives from a ``TransformationPass`` or "
"``AnalysisPass``. Transformation passes modify the circuit, while "
"analysis passes only collect information about a circuit (to be used by "
"other passes). Then, the ``run(dag)`` method is implemented, which does "
"the main task. Finally, the pass is registered inside the "
"``qiskit.transpiler.passes`` module."

"This pass functions as follows: it traverses the DAG layer-by-layer (each"
" layer is a group of operations that does not act on independent qubits, "

" the pass identifies a swap path and inserts swaps to bring the two "
