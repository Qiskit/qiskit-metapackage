"Qiskit Aer currently includes three high performance simulator backends: "
"\\* ``QasmSimulator``: Allows ideal and noisy multi-shot execution of "
"qiskit circuits and returns counts or memory \\* "
"``StatevectorSimulator``: Allows ideal single-shot execution of qiskit "
"circuits and returns the final statevector of the simulator after "
"application \\* ``UnitarySimulator``: Allows ideal single-shot execution "
"of qiskit circuits and returns the final unitary matrix of the circuit "
"itself. Note that the circuit cannot contain measure or reset operations "
"for this backend"
