"When constructing quantum circuits, there are several properties that "
"help quantify the \"size\" of the circuits, and their ability to be run "
"on a noisy quantum device. Some of these, like number of qubits, are "
"straightforward to understand, while others like depth and number of "
"tensor components require a bit more explanation. Here we will explain "
"all of these properties, and, in preparation for understanding how "
"circuits change when run on actual devices, highlight the conditions "
"under which they change."

"From the plot, it is easy to see that this circuit has 12 qubits, and a "
"collection of Hadamard, CNOT, X, and SWAP gates. But how to quantify this"
" programmatically? Because we can do single-qubit gates on all the qubits"
" simultaneously, the number of qubits in this circuit is equal to the "
"**width** of the circuit:"

"Warning: For a quantum circuit composed from just qubits, the circuit "
"width is equal to the number of qubits. This is the definition used in "
"quantum computing. However, for more complicated circuits with classical "
"registers, and classically controlled gates, this equivalence breaks "

"A particularly important circuit property is known as the **depth**. The "
"depth of a quantum circuit is a measure of how many \"layers\" of quantum"
" gates, executed in parallel, it takes to complete the computation "
"defined by the circuit. Because quantum gates take time to implement, the"
" depth of a circuit roughly corresponds to the amount of time it takes "
"the quantum computer to execute the circuit. Thus, the depth of a circuit"
" is one important quantity used to measure if a quantum circuit can be "
"run on a device."

"The depth of a quantum circuit has a mathematical definition as the "
"longest path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, such a "
"definition is a bit hard to grasp, even for experts. Fortunately, the "
"depth of a circuit can be easily understood by anyone familiar with "
"playing `Tetris <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris>`__. To understand "
"this, let us redraw the circuit with the first five CNOT gates colored "
"differently for clarity:"

"To compute the depth, we turn the circuit counterclockwise so that the "
"beginning of the circuit is at the bottom. We then let the gates fall to "
"the bottom. Later gates stack on earlier gates, and multi-qubit gate "
"components must be stacked at the same height. For the current circuit of"

"We can see that the first five CNOT gates all collapsed down on top of "
"each other, and are stacked on top of the initial set of Hadamard gates. "
"The remaining gates stack on top of the CNOT layer as shown. The stack of"
" gates can be partitioned into \"layers\", where each layer represents a "
"set of gates that can be executed in parallel on a quantum device "
"(Hardware limitations may restrict the number and/or type of gates that "
"can be run in parallel). The **depth** of the circuit is just the number "
"of layers in the circuit; The depth is equal to the height of the stack "
"of gates. This computation is done for you in qiskit, and we can verify "

"The circuit we are focusing on here is a 12-qubit circuit. However, does "
"this circuit actually require a 12-qubit quantum computer to run? That is"

"smaller circuits individually?"

"In the limit where only single-qubit gates are performed, it should be "
"clear that each qubit is controlled independently of the rest, and thus "
"we can run each qubit independently and still get the desired result. "
"Thus, the question becomes are there enough entangling gates in the "
"circuit to have all qubits interacting? Again, this is best understood in"
" terms of diagrams. Below, we track the sets of qubits that interact "
"amongst themselves via CNOT gates at each layer in the circuit."
