"Here, we provide an overview of working with Qiskit. The fundamental "
"package of Qiskit is Terra that provides the basic building blocks "
"necessary to program quantum computers. The fundamental unit of Qiskit is"
" the `**quantum circuit** "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`__. A basic workflow "
"using Qiskit consists of two stages: **Build** and **Execute**. **Build**"
" allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem"
" you are solving, and **Execute** that allows you to run them on "
"different backends. After the jobs have been run, the data is collected "
"and postprocessed depending on the desired output."
