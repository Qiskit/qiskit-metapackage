"U can be implemented as a \"quantum multiplexor\" gate, since it is a "
"block diagonal matrix. In the quantum multiplexor formalism, a block "
"diagonal matrix of size :math:`2^n \\times 2^n`, and consisting of "
":math:`2^s` blocks, is equivalent to a multiplexor with :math:`s` select "
"qubits and :math:`n-s` data qubits. Depending on the state of the select "
"qubits, the corresponding blocks are applied to the data qubits. A "
"multiplexor of this kind can be implemented after recursive decomposition"
" to primitive gates of cx, rz and ry."
