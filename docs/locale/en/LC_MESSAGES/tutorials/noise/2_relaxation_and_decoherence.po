"This shows how to generate the circuits. The list of qubits specifies for"
" which qubits to generate characterization circuits; these circuits will "
"run in parallel. The discrete unit of time is the identity gate "
"(``iden``) and so the user must specify the time of each identity gate if"
" they would like the characterization parameters returned in units of "
"time. This should be available from the backend."
