"The returned dictionary is also a counts dictionary but the keys "
"correspond to the which subsystems the operators are acting on and the "
"counts are the un-normalized expectation values. The counts can be "
"converted to expectation values by dividing by the value of the all '0's "
"entry. The '0's key is the expectation value of the identity operator, "
"and its value is equal to the number of shots ."
