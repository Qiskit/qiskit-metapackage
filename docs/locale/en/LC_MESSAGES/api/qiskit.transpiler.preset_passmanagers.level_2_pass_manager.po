msgid ""
"This pass manager applies the user-given initial layout. If none is "
"given, and device calibration information is available, the circuit is "
"mapped to the qubits with best readouts and to CX gates with highest "
"fidelity. Otherwise, a layout on the most densely connected qubits is "
"used. The pass manager then transforms the circuit to match the coupling "
"constraints. It is then unrolled to the basis, and any flipped cx "
"directions are fixed. Finally, optimizations in the form of commutative "
"gate cancellation and redundant reset removal are performed. Note: in "
"simulators where coupling_map=None, only the unrolling and optimization "
"stages are done."
