"If multiple classical registers are used to measure various parts of a "
"quantum system, Each of the measurement dictionary's keys would contain "
"spaces as delimiters to separate the various parts being measured. For "
"example, you might have three keys '11 010', '01 011' and '11 011', among"
" many other, in the count dictionary of the 5-qubit complete system, and "
"would like to get the two subsystems' counts (one 2-qubit, and the other "
"3-qubit) in order to get the counts for the 2-qubit partial measurement "
"'11' or the 3-qubit partial measurement '011'."
