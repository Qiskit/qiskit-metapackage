"This pass manager applies the user-given initial layout. If none is "
"given, and a trivial layout (i-th virtual -> i-th physical) makes the "
"circuit fit the coupling map, that is used. Otherwise, the circuit is "
"mapped to the most densely connected coupling subgraph, and swaps are "
"inserted to map. Any unused physical qubit is allocated as ancilla space."
" The pass manager then unrolls the circuit to the desired basis, and "
"transforms the circuit to match the coupling map. Finally, optimizations "
"in the form of adjacent gate collapse and redundant reset removal are "
"performed. Note: in simulators where coupling_map=None, only the "
"unrolling and optimization stages are done."
