#: ../../getting_started.rst:7
msgid ""
"**Build**: design a quantum circuit that represents the problem you are "
"considering."

#: ../../getting_started.rst:9

"**Execute**: run experiments on different backends (*which include both "
"systems and simulators*)."

"experiments."

"The default simulator provider is ``Aer``. However, if you have issues "
"with installing this provider there is also a basic aer provider. To use "
"this provider replace ``Aer`` with ``BasicAer`` in the above code."

"The default backend for ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()`` or "
"``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` is the text backend. However, depending on your"
" local environment you may want to change these defaults to something "
"better suited for your use case. This is done with the user config file."
"  By default the user config file should be located in "
"``~/.qiskit/settings.conf`` and is a ``.ini`` file."
