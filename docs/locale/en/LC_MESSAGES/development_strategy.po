"In 2018 we worked on formalizing the backends and user flow in Qiskit "
"Terra. The basic idea is as follows: the user designs a quantum circuit "
"and then, through a set of transpiler passes, rewrites the circuit to run"
" on different backends with different optimizations. We also introduced "
"the concept of a *provider*, whose role is to supply backends for the "
"user to run quantum circuits on. The provider API we have defined at "
"version one supplies a set of schemas to verify that the provider and its"
" backends are Terra-compatible."

"The Qiskit project is made up of several elements each performing "

"While not strictly related to the meta-package and Qiskit versioning how "

"It is also worth pointing out that the order we install the elements is "

"we need to ensure that the order in the requirements list installs "
