msgid "If multiple classical registers are used to measure various parts of a quantum system, Each of the measurement dictionary's keys would contain spaces as delimiters to separate the various parts being measured. For example, you might have three keys '11 010', '01 011' and '11 011', among many other, in the count dictionary of the 5-qubit complete system, and would like to get the two subsystems' counts (one 2-qubit, and the other 3-qubit) in order to get the counts for the 2-qubit partial measurement '11' or the 3-qubit partial measurement '011'."
