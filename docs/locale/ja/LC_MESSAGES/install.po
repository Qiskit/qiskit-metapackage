msgid "Since the Qiskit package includes a constellation of different elements, simply printing the version by running ``qiskit.__version__`` can be misleading as it returns only the version for the ``qiskit-terra`` package. This is because the ``qiskit`` namespace in Python doesn't come from the Qiskit package, but instead is part of the ``qiskit-terra`` package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:166
msgid "To see the versions of all the Qiskit elements in your environment you can use the ``__qiskit_version__`` attribute. For example, running the following command will return a dictionary that includes the versions for each of the installed Qiskit packages."
