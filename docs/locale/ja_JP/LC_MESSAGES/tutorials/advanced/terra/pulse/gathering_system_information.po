msgid "Programming a quantum computer at the microwave pulse level requires more information about the device than is required at the circuit level. A quantum circuit is built for an abstract quantum computer -- it will yield the same quantum state on any quantum computer (except for varying performance levels). A pulse schedule, on the other hand, is so specific to the device, that running one program on two different backends is not expected to have the same result, even on perfectly noiseless systems."

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/gathering_system_information.ipynb:17
msgid "As a basic example, imagine a drive pulse ``q0_X180`` calibrated on qubit 0 to enact an :math:`X180` pulse, which flips the state of qubit 0. If we use the samples from that pulse on qubit 1 on the same device, or qubit 0 on another device, we do not know what the resulting state will be -- but we can be pretty sure it won't be an :math:`X180` operation. The qubits are each unique, with various drive coupling strengths. If we have specified a frequency for the drive pulse, it's very probable that pulse would have little effect on another qubit, which has its own resonant frequency."

msgid "With that, we have motivated why information from the backend may be very useful at times for building Pulse schedules. The information included in a ``backend`` is broken into three main parts:"

msgid "The first thing you'll need to do is grab a backend to inspect. Here we use a mocked backend that contains a snapshot of data from the real OpenPulse-enabled backend."

msgid "Neat! All of the above configuration is available for any backend, whether enabled with OpenPulse or not, although it is not an exhaustive list. There are additional attributes available on Pulse backends. Let's go into a bit more detail with those."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/gathering_system_information.ipynb:95
msgid "The **timescale**, ``dt``, is backend dependent. Think of this as the inverse sampling rate of the control rack's arbitrary waveform generators. Each sample point and duration in a Pulse ``Schedule`` is given in units of this timescale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/gathering_system_information.ipynb:151
msgid "The configuration also provides information that is useful for building measurements. Pulse supports three measurement levels: ``0: RAW``, ``1: KERNELED``, and ``2: DISCRIMINATED``. The ``meas_levels`` attribute tells us which of those are supported by this backend. To learn how to execute programs with these different levels, see this page -- COMING SOON."

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/pulse/gathering_system_information.ipynb:185
msgid "For backends which support measurement level 0, the sampling rate of the control rack's analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) also becomes relevant. The configuration also has this info, where ``dtm`` is the time per sample returned:"
