msgid "Qiskit Optimization provides with ``QuadraticProgram`` a very generic and powerful representation for optimization problems. However, usually, optimization algorithms cannot handle all possible types of problems that can be modelled, but only a sub-class. Many available quantum optimization algorithms can handle Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. To do so, first, it is necessary to convert a given optimization problem into a QUBO."

msgid "Qiskit Optimization provides converters to achieve this conversion whenever possible. More precisely, Qiskit Optimization provides the following converters: - ``InequalityToEquality``: converts inequality constraints into equality constraints with additional slack variables. - ``IntegerToBinary``: converts integer variables into binary variables and corresponding coefficients. - ``LinearEqualityToPenalty``: convert equality constraints into additional terms of the object function. - ``QuadraticProgramToQubo``: a wrapper for ``IntegerToBinary`` and ``LinearEqualityToPenalty`` for convenience."
