msgid "An interesting class of optimization problems to be addressed by quantum computing are Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. QUBO is equivalent to finding the ground state of a corresponding Hamiltonian, which is an important problem not only in optimization, but also in quantum chemistry and physics. For this translation, the binary variables taking values in :math:`\\{0, 1\\}` are replaced by spin variables taking values in :math:`\\{-1, +1\\}`, which allows to replace the resulting spin variables by Pauli Z matrices, and thus, an Hamiltonian. For more details on this mapping we refere to [1]."

msgid "Qiskit provides automatic conversion from a suitable ``QuadraticProgram`` to an Ising Hamiltonian, which then allows to leverage all the ``MinimumEigenSolver`` available in Qiskit Aqua, such as - ``VQE``, - ``QAOA``, or - ``NumpyMinimumEigensolver`` (classical exact method)."

msgid "In the following we first illustrate the conversion from a ``QuadraticProgram`` to an ``Operator`` and then show how to use the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` with different ``MinimumEigensolver`` to solve a given ``QuadraticProgram``. The algorithms in Qiskit automatically try to convert a given problem to the supported problem class if possible, for instance, the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` will automatically translate integer variables to binary variables or add a linear equality constraints as a quadratic penalty term to the objective."

msgid "The circuit depth of ``QAOA`` potentially has to be increased with the problem size, which might be prohibitive for near-term quantum devices. A possible workaround is Recursive QAOA, as introduced in [2]. Qiskit generalizes this concept to the ``RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer``, which is introduced at the end of this tutorial."

Once the size of the generated intermediate problem is below a given threshold (``min...``), the ``RecurisveMinimumEigenOptimizer`` uses another solver (``...``), e.g., an exact classical solver such as CPLEX or the ``MinimumEigenOptimizer`` based on the ``NumPyMinimumEigensolver``."
