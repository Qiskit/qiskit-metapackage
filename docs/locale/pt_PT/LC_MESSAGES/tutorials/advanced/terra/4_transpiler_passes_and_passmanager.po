msgid "A central component of Qiskit Terra is the transpiler, which is designed for modularity and extensibility. The goal is to be able to easily write new circuit transformations (known as transpiler **passes**), and combine them with other existing passes. Which passes are chained together and in which order has a major effect on the final outcome. This pipeline is determined by a **pass manager**, which schedules the passes and also allows passes to communicate with each other by providing a shared space. In this way, the transpiler opens up the door for research into aggressive optimization of quantum circuits."

msgid "In this notebook, we look at the built-in passes, how to use the pass manager, and develop a simple custom transpiler pass. In order to do the latter, we first need to introduce the internal representation of quantum circuits in Qiskit, in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph, or **DAG**. Then, we illustrate a simple swap mapper pass, which transforms an input circuit to be compatible with a limited-connectivity quantum device."

msgid "There can be passes that do the same job, but in different ways. For example, the ``TrivialLayout``, ``DenseLayout`` and ``NoiseAdaptiveLayout`` all choose a layout (binding of virtual qubits to physical qubits), but use different algorithms and objectives. Similarly, the ``BasicSwap``, ``LookaheadSwap`` and ``StochasticSwap`` all insert swaps to make the circuit compatible with the coupling map. The modularity of the transpiler allows plug-and-play replacements for each pass."

msgid "Qiskit comes with several pre-defined pass managers, corresponding to various levels of optimization achieved through different pipelines of passes. Currently ``optimization_level`` 0 through 3 are supported; the higher the number, the more optimized it is, at the expense of more time. Choosing a good pass manager may take trial and error, as it depends heavily on the circuit being transpiled and the backend being targeted."

msgid "In Qiskit, we represent circuits internally using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The advantage of this representation over a pure list of gates (i.e., *netlist*) is that the flow of information between operations are explicit, making it easier for passes to make transformation decisions without changing the semantics of the circuit."

msgid "In the DAG, there are three kinds of graph nodes: qubit/clbit input nodes (green), operation nodes (blue), and output nodes (red). Each edge indicates data flow (or dependency) between two nodes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/advanced/terra/4_transpiler_passes_and_passmanager.ipynb:790
msgid "The first thing to do when writing a transpiler pass is to decide whether the pass class derives from a ``TransformationPass`` or ``AnalysisPass``. Transformation passes modify the circuit, while analysis passes only collect information about a circuit (to be used by other passes). Then, the ``run(dag)`` method is implemented, which does the main task. Finally, the pass is registered inside the ``qiskit.transpiler.passes`` module."

msgid "Note that this pass only inserts the swaps necessary to make every two-qubit interaction conform to the device coupling map. It does not, for example, care about the direction of interactions, or the native gate set supported by the device. This is a design philosophy of Qiskit's transpiler: every pass performs a small, well-defined action, and the aggressive circuit optimization is achieved by the pass manager through combining multiple passes."

msgid "Due to the complexity of the internal operations that the transpiler is performing it's likely that you'll end up in a situation where you'd like to debug an issue or just understand more of what is happening inside the transpiler when you call it. To facilitate this the transpiler emits log messages as part of its normal operation. This logging uses the Python standard library ``logging`` module to emit the log messages. Python's standard logging was used because it allows Qiskit-Terra's logging to integrate in a standard way with other applications and libraries."
