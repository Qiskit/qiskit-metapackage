msgid "Here, we provide an overview of working with Qiskit. The fundamental package of Qiskit is Terra that provides the basic building blocks necessary to program quantum computers. The fundamental unit of Qiskit is the `**quantum circuit** <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`__. A basic workflow using Qiskit consists of two stages: **Build** and **Execute**. **Build** allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving, and **Execute** that allows you to run them on different backends. After the jobs have been run, the data is collected and postprocessed depending on the desired output."

Suppose there are :math:`n` qubits, and qubit :math:`j` is labeled as :math:`Q_{j}`. Qiskit uses an ordering in which the :math:`n^{\\mathrm{th}}` qubit is on the left side of the tensor product, so that the basis vectors are labeled as :math:`Q_n\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes Q_1\\otimes Q_0`."
