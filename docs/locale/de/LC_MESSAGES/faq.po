msgid "**A:** This is a pylint error, which is a Linter for Python. Linters analyze code for potential errors, and they throw errors when they find potentially erroneous code. However, this error should not prevent your code from compiling or running, so there is no need to worry. The error message can be disabled by adding the following line above the code that is causing the error:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:32

msgid "The error is caused when trying to import the Qiskit package in an environment where Qiskit is not installed. If you launched Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda-Navigator, it is possible that Jupyter Notebook is running in the base (root) environment, instead of in your virtual environment. Choose a virtual environment in the Anaconda-Navigator from the **Applications on** dropdown menu. In this menu, you can see see all of the virtual environments within Anaconda, and you can select the environment where you have Qiskit installed to launch Jupyter Notebook."
