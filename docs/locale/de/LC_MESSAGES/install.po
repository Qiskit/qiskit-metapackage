msgid "Qiskit supports Python 3.5 or later. However, both Python and Qiskit are evolving ecosystems, and sometimes when new releases occur in one or the other, there can be problems with compatibility."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:11
msgid "If you're having trouble installing or using Qiskit after updating Python, check the `Qiskit Package metadata <https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/>`__ for **Programming Language** to see which specific versions of Python are supported."

#: ../../install.rst:15
msgid "We recommend installing `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__, a cross-platform Python distribution for scientific computing. Jupyter, included in Anaconda, is recommended for interacting with Qiskit."

#: ../../install.rst:40
msgid "The simplest way to use environments is by using the ``conda`` command, included with Anaconda. A Conda environment allows you to specify a specific version of Python and set of libraries. Open a terminal window in the directory where you want to work."

If you do not have pip 19 installed you can run ``pip install -U pip`` to upgrade it. Without pip 19 or newer this command will attempt to install qiskit-aer from sdist (source distribution) which will try to compile aer locally under the covers."

msgid "Checking Which Version is Installed"
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:164
msgid "Since the Qiskit package includes a constellation of different elements, simply printing the version by running ``qiskit.__version__`` can be misleading as it returns only the version for the ``qiskit-terra`` package. This is because the ``qiskit`` namespace in Python doesn't come from the Qiskit package, but instead is part of the ``qiskit-terra`` package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../install.rst:176
msgid "To see the versions of all the Qiskit elements in your environment you can use the ``__qiskit_version__`` attribute. For example, running the following command will return a dictionary that includes the versions for each of the installed Qiskit packages."

#: ../../install.rst:187
msgid "If you're filing an issue or need to share your installed Qiskit versions for something, use the ``__qiskit_version__`` attribute."
