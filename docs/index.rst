Qiskit |version| documentation
##############################

Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers
at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.  Additionally, several
domain specific application API's exist on top of this core module.

The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack
that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or
area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run
them on real quantum computers and/or classical simulators.  Qiskit is already in use
around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.
