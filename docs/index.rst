##############################

Qiskit is open-source software for working with quantum computers
at the level of circuits, pulses, and algorithms.

The central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack
that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers, regardless of their skill level or
area of interest; Qiskit allows one to easily design experiments and applications and run
them on real quantum computers or classical simulators. Qiskit is already in use
around the world by beginners, hobbyists, educators, researchers, and commercial companies.
