======================

Qiskit is an open-source project committed to bringing quantum computing to people of all backgrounds. This page describes how you can join the Qiskit community in this goal.

Writing Documentation
---------------------

Qiskit documentation is shaped by the `docs as code <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/>`_ philosophy.

The `published documentation <https://qiskit.org/documentation/index.html>`_ is built from the master branch of `Qiskit/qiskit/docs <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/master/docs>`_ using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_.

The Python API reference documentation is automatically generated from comments in the code by navigating to your local clone of `Qiskit/qiskit <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit>`_ and running the following command in a terminal window:

.. code:: sh

  make doc
