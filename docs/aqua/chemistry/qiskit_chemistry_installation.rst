Installation and Setup
======================

Qiskit Chemistry is automatically installed during the Qiskit Aqua installation as it forms
part of Qiskit Aqua. Please see :ref:`aqua-installation` for detailed instructions.

Qiskit Chemistry does however require the installation of a chemistry driver
in order to use it fully, please see the next section below.

---------------------------------
Installation of Chemistry Drivers
---------------------------------

To run chemistry experiments on various molecules, you will also need to install at least one of
the supported classical computational chemistry programs, or *drivers*, interfaced by
Qiskit Chemistry. Currently, Qiskit Chemistry comes with built-in interfaces for four drivers:

1. `Gaussianâ„¢ 16 <http://gaussian.com/gaussian16/>`__, a commercial chemistry program
2. `PSI4 <http://www.psicode.org/>`__, an open-source chemistry program built on Python
3. `PySCF <https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf>`__, an open-source Python chemistry program
4. `PyQuante <http://pyquante.sourceforge.net/>`__, a pure cross-platform open-source Python
   chemistry program

.. note::

    For non-Windows platforms the PySCF driver is automatically installed as a dependency
    of Qiskit Chemistry. You are free however to add additional driver(s) and use
    the one(s) of your choosing.

While the logic to interface these drivers is supplied as part of the Qiskit Chemistry
installation, the dependent chemistry programs need to be installed separately.
This can be done by following the instructions provided in Section ":ref:`drivers`".

Even without installing any of the drivers above, it is still possible to run chemistry experiments
by using a previously created Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) binary file. Such files are created
by saving the intermediate data previously generated by one of the supported chemistry drivers.
This offers researchers the opportunity to share chemistry input files and replicate each other's
results.  Given its support to take an HDF5 files as the input to initiate a chemistry experiment,
Qiskit Chemistry has :ref:`hdf5` as an additional driver --- in fact, the only built-in driver
coming with Qiskit Chemistry.

A few sample HDF5 files are provided as input files in the ``chemistry`` folder of the
`Qiskit Tutorials Community \
<https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials-community/tree/master/chemistry/input_files>`__
repository.

Supporting additional drivers in Qiskit Chemistry can be easily achieved by extending
the ``BaseDriver`` interface. See "Extending Qiskit Chemistry with Support for New Drivers"
in :ref:`drivers` section for more detail.
