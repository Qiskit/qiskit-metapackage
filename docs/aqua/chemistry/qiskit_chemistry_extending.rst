Contributing to Qiskit Chemistry
==============================

Qiskit Chemistry, just like the Aqua library it is built upon, has a modular and extensible architecture.

Instead of just *accessing* Qiskit Chemistry as a library of quantum algorithms and tools to experiment with quantum
computing for chemistry, a user may decide to *contribute* to Qiskit Chemistry by
providing new components.
These can be programmatically added to Qiskit Chemistry,
which was designed as an extensible, pluggable
framework.  Once added, new components are automatically discovered.

.. topic:: Contribution Guidelines

    Any user who would like to contribute to Aqua or Qiskit Chemistry should follow the Aqua `contribution
    guidelines <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-chemistry/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`__.

---------------------------------
Dynamically Discovered Components
---------------------------------

Researchers and developers can contribute to Qiskit Chemistry
by providing new components, which will be automatically discovered and loaded by Aqua at run time.
Each component should derive from the corresponding base class, as explained below.  There are two
ways for a component to be dynamically discovered and loaded by Qiskit Chemistry at run time:

1. The class implementing the component should be placed in the appropriate folder in the file system,
   as explained in `Section "Extension Points" <#extension-points>`__ below for each different component type.
   This is the easiest approach.  Researchers
   and developers extending Qiskit Chemistry are more likely to have installed Qiskit Chemistry by cloning the
   `Qiskit Chemistry GitHub repository <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-chemistry>`__ as opposed to using
   the pip package manager system.  Therefore, the folders indicated below can be easily located in the file system.

2. Alternatively, a developer extending Qiskit Chemistry with a new component can simply create a dedicated
   repository with its own versioning.  This repository must be locally installable with the package that was
   created.  It simply consists of customizing the
   ``setup.py`` fadding the entry points for ``qiskit.chemistry.drivers`` and or
   ``qiskit.chemistry.operators`` as shown below.
   The format is: ``anyname = full_package:class_name``. Each class must be included separately.
   When someone installs the package, the extensions will be automatically registered:

   .. code:: python

       import setuptools

       long_description = """New Package for Qiskit Chemistry Component"""
    
       requirements = [
          "qiskit-chemistry>=0.4.2",
          "qiskit-terra>=0.7.0,<0.8",
          "numpy>=1.13"
       ]
    
       setuptools.setup(
          name = 'qiskit_chemistry_custom_component_package',
          version = "0.1.0", # this should match __init__.__version__
          description='Qiskit Chemistry Component',
          long_description = long_description,
          long_description_content_type = "text/markdown",

          classifiers = (

             "Topic :: Scientific/Engineering"
          ),
          keywords = 'qiskit sdk quantum aqua',
          packages = setuptools.find_packages(exclude=['test*']),
          install_requires = requirements,
          include_package_data = True,
          python_requires = ">=3.5",
          entry_points={
               'qiskit.chemistry.operators': [
                  'MyOperator = qiskit_chemistry_custom_component_package:MyOperatorClass',
               ],
               'qiskit.chemistry.drivers': [
                  'MyDriver = qiskit_chemistry_custom_component_package:MyDriverClass',
               ],
         },
       )


----------------
Extension Points
----------------
This section details the components that researchers and developers
can contribute to Qiskit Chemistry.
Qiskit Chemistry exposes two extension points:

1. :ref:`chemistry-drivers`
2. :ref:`chemistry-operators`

.. _chemistry-drivers:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chemistry Drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The driver support in Qiskit Chemistry was designed to make the :ref:`drivers` pluggable and discoverable.
In order for Qiskit Chemistry to
be able to interface a driver library, the ``BaseDriver`` base class must be implemented so to
provide the interfacing code, or *wrapper*.  As part of this process, the required
`JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <http://json.org>`__ schema for the driver interface must
be supplied in a CONFIGURATION static property in the class.  The interfacing code in the driver wrapper
is responsible for constructing and populating a ``QMolecule`` instance with the electronic
structure data listed above.  Driver wrappers implementing the ``BaseDriver`` class are organized 
in subfolders of the ``drivers`` folder for automatic discovery and dynamic lookup.

.. _chemistry-operators:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Chemistry Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chemistry operators convert the electronic structure information obtained from the
drivers to qubit-operator forms, suitable to be processed by the Aqua :ref:`quantum-algorithms`.  New chemistry operators
can be plugged in by extending the ``ChemistryOperator`` interface and providing the required
`JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <>`__ schema in a CONFIGURATION static property in the class.
Chemistry operator implementations are collected in the ``core`` folder
for automatic discovery and dynamic lookup.


----------
Unit Tests
----------

Contributing new software components to Qiskit Chemistry requires writing new unit tests for those components,
and executing all the existing unit tests to make sure that no bugs were inadvertently injected.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Writing Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Unit tests should go under the ``test`` folder and be classes derived from
the ``QiskitAquaChemistryTestCase`` class.  They should not have ``print`` statements;
rather, they should use ``self.log.debug``. If
they use assertions, these should be from the ``unittest`` package, such as
``self.AssertTrue``, ``self.assertRaises``, etc.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Executing Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To run all unit tests, execute the following command:

.. code:: sh

    python -m unittest discover

To run a particular unit test module, the following command should be used:

.. code:: sh

    python -m unittest test/test_end2end.py

The command for help is as follows:

.. code::

    python -m unittest -h

`Other running options <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#command-line-options>`__ are available
to users for consultation.

In order to see unit test log messages, researchers and developers contributing to Aqua
will need to set the ``LOG_LEVEL`` environment variable to ``DEBUG`` mode:

.. code:: sh

    LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
    export LOG_LEVEL

The results from ``self.log.debug`` will be saved to a
file with same name as the module used to run, and with a ``log`` extension. For instance,
the ``test_end2end.py`` script in the example above will generate a log file named
``test_end2end.log`` in the ``test`` folder.
