Problems that can benefit from the power of quantum computing
have been identified in numerous
domains, such as Chemistry, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Optimization
and Finance. Quantum computing, however, requires very specialized skills.
To address the needs of the vast population of practitioners who want to use and
contribute to quantum computing at various levels of the software stack, we have
created :ref:`aqua-library` that can be invoked directly or via domain-specific computational
applications:
:ref:`aqua-chemistry`, :ref:`aqua-ai`, :ref:`aqua-optimization` and
:ref:`aqua-finance`.
Finally, :ref:`aqua-tutorials` is a companion library of notebooks, input files and sample code
which are available from the
`Qiskit Tutorials GitHub repository <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials>`__.

This part of the documentation will first cover Aqua as a library of quantum applications,
and then the domain-specific applications of Aqua: Chemistry, AI and Optimization.
