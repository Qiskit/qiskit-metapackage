Aqua Tutorials
**************

A large number of tutorials illustrating how to use and extend Qiskit Aqua and its applications
are available in the ``qiskit/aqua`` and ``community/aqua`` folders of the
`Qiskit Tutorials <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials>`__ repository.

In both ``qiskit`` and ``community`` folders you will also find Aqua domain examples in folders
``artificial_intelligence``, ``chemistry``, ``finance`` and ``optimization``

These tutorials are a set of code examples,
`Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`__ and sample input files
that enable experimenting with :ref:`aqua-library`, :ref:`aqua-chemistry`, :ref:`aqua-ai`
and :ref:`aqua-optimization`.  The programs included demonstrate
how to use Aqua and its domain-specific applications programmatically, and also
how to extend Aqua with new components.  This feature is particularly useful to
quantum researchers who are interested in :ref:`aqua-extending` with new algorithmic
components.

The `Qiskit Tutorials repository <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials>`__ is supposed to be
installed via the ``git clone`` command.  This will allow the user to duplicate its code in a
convenient location in the file system, where it will be easier to browse the examples and
execute the Jupyter Notebooks we provide.

A `Jupyter Notebook nbviewer of featured Qiskit tutorials
<https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/start_here.ipynb>`__
and a `Jupyter Notebook nbviewer of Aqua community tutorials
<https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/community/aqua/index.ipynb>`__
allow for a quick and intuitive way to browse through the various sample programs presented.
