Qiskit Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a set of tools and algorithms
that enable experimenting with AI problems via quantum computing. Aqua AI
is the only end-to-end software stack that translates AI-specific problems
into inputs for one of the :ref:`quantum-algorithms` in :ref:`aqua-library`,
which in turn uses Qiskit Terra for the actual quantum computation on top a
quantum simulator or a real quantum hardware device.

Qiskit AI allows users with different levels of experience to execute AI
experiments and contribute to the quantum computing AI software stack.
Users with a pure AI background or interests can continue to configure AI problems
without having to learn the details of quantum computing.

---------------------
Applicable Algorithms
---------------------

There are numerous algorithms from :ref:`aqua-library` that can be applied
to AI problems.

AI-specific Quantum Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aqua AI comes with two quantum Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms
already integrated into the Aqua library:

1. The :ref:`svm-q-kernel` algorithm applies to classification problems that
   require a feature map for which computing the kernel is not efficient
   classically. This means that the required computational resources are
   expected to scale exponentially with the size of the problem.
   SVM Q Kernel uses a Quantum processor to solve this problem by a direct
   estimation of the kernel in the feature space. The method used falls in
   the category of what is called *supervised learning*, consisting of a
   *training phase* (where the kernel is calculated and the support vectors
   obtained) and a *test or classification phase* (where new labelless data
   is classified according to the solution found in the training phase).

2. The :ref:`svm-variational` algorithm also applies to
   classification problems that require a feature map for which computing
   the kernel is not efficient classically. SVM Variational uses the variational
   method to solve such problems in a quantum processor.  Specifically, it optimizes
   a parameterized quantum circuit to provide a solution that cleanly
   separates the data.

General Quantum Algorithms for AI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other quantum algorithms available in Aqua
that can be used to experiment with AI problems
include :ref:`vqe`, :ref:`qaoa`, :ref:`qpe`, :ref:`iqpe` and :ref:`grover`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Classical Reference Algorithms for AI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To produce reference values and compare and contrast results during experimentation,
the Aqua library of :ref:`classical-reference-algorithms` also includes the
:ref:`avm-rbf-kernel` classical algorithm.

Research and developers interested in :ref:`aqua-extending` with new AI-specific
capabilities can take advantage
of the modular architecture of Aqua and easily extend Aqua with more algorithms
and algorithm components, such as new :ref:`oracles` for the :ref:`grover` algorithm,
:ref:`optimizers` and :ref:`variational-forms` for :ref:`vqe`, :ref:`qaoa`, and :ref:`svm-variational`,
:ref:`iqfts` for :ref:`qpe`, :ref:`initial-states` for :ref:`variational-forms`,
as well as :ref:`feature-maps` and :ref:`multiclass-extensions` for Support Vector Machine
(SVM) algorithms, such as :ref:`svm-variational` and :ref:`svm-q-kernel`.

The ``artificial_intelligence`` folder of the `Aqua Tutorials GitHub Repository
<https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua-tutorials>`__ contains numerous
`Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`__ and input data files
explaining how to use Aqua AI.
