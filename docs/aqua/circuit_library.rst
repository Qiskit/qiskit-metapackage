Aqua provides easy access to a collection of commonly used circuits and gates
to be used as the building blocks for various components, algorithms and applications.
The gates can be enabled by corresponding imports from ``qiskit.aqua.circuits.gates``
and the invoked from ``QuantumCircuit`` objects.
The circuits can be accessed by importing corresponding classes from ``qiskit.aqua.circuits``.



.. _mct:

.. topic:: Multiple-Control Toffoli (MCT) Gate

    The *Multiple-Control Toffoli (mct)* gate, as the name suggests, is
    a generalization of the traditional Toffoli gate s.t. one target qubit is
    controlled by an arbitrary number of control qubits for a NOT (`x`) operation.
    The MCT gate can be used as the building block
    for implementing various different quantum algorithms, such as Grover's search.

    For the different numbers 0, 1, 2, … of controls, we have corresponding
    quantum gates ``x``, ``cx``, ``ccx``, ... The first three are basic/well-known
    quantum gates. In Aqua, ``mct`` provides support for arbitrary
    numbers of controls, in particular, 3 or above.

    Currently three different implementation strategies are included: *basic*,
    *advanced*, and *noancilla*. The basic mode employs a textbook
    implementation, where a series of ``ccx`` Toffoli gates are linked
    together in a ``V`` shape to achieve the desired Multiple-Control Toffoli
    operation. This mode requires :math:`n-2` ancillary qubits, where
    :math:`n` is the number of controls. For the advanced mode, the ``cccx``
    and ``ccccx`` operations are achieved without needing ancillary
    qubits. Multiple-Control Toffoli operations for higher
    number of controls (5 and above) are implemented recursively using these
    lower-number-of-control cases. For the noancilla mode, no ancillary
    qubits are needed even for higher number of controls. This uses a
    technique of spliting multiple-control Toffoli operations, which is
    efficient up to 8 controls but gets inefficient in the number of required
    basic gates for values above. This technique relies on ``mcu1``, see
    :ref:`mcux` for more information.

    Aqua's MCT gate can be invoked from a ``QuantumCircuit`` object
    using the ``mct`` API, which expects a list ``q_controls`` of control qubits,
    a target qubit ``q_target``, and a list ``q_ancilla`` of ancillary qubits.
    An optional keyword argument ``mode`` can also be passed in to indicate
    whether the ``'basic'``, ``'advanced'``, or ``'noancilla'`` mode is chosen.
    If omitted, this argument defaults to ``'basic'``.


.. _mcux:

.. topic:: Multiple-Control U1 and U3 Rotation (MCU1 and MCU3) Gates

    The *Multiple-Control Rotation (mcu)* gates, implements a U1 (`u1`)
    and a U3 (`u3`) rotations on a single target qubit with an arbitrary
    number of control qubits. The MCU1 operation takes one rotation angle
    as input parameter, whereas the MCU3 operation takes three for arbitrary
    rotations. No ancillary qubits are needed. It is efficiently implemented
    by using a grey code sequence for up to 8 control qubits. For larger
    number of controls this implementation gets very inefficient.

    Aqua's ``mcu1`` and ``mcu3`` operations can be invoked from a ``QuantumCircuit``
    object and expect a list ``control_qubits`` of control qubits and a target
    qubit ``target_qubit`` as well as an angle ``theta`` for the mcu1 and
    additionally two angles ``phi`` and ``lam`` for the mcu3.


.. _mcmt:

.. topic:: Multiple-Control Multiple-Target (MCMT) Gate

    The *Multiple-Control Multiple-Target (mcmt)* Gate, as the name suggests,
    allows to generalize a single-control, single-target gate (such as `cz`) to
    support multiple control qubits and multiple target qubits.
    In other words, the single-control gate passed as argument is applied to all
    the target qubits if all the control qubits are active.

    The kind of gate to apply can be passed as a parameter and should be a single
    control gate already defined for a ``QuantumCircuit`` object (such as
    ``QuantumCircuit.cz`` or ``QuantumCircuit.ch``).

    Currently, just one implementation strategy is implemented: *basic*. It
    employs almost the same strategy adopted for the basic mode of `mct`:
    multiple Toffoli gates are chained together to get the logical `AND` of
    all the control qubits on a single ancilla qubit, which is then used as the
    control of the single-control gate function.

    This mode requires :math:`n-1` ancillary qubits, where :math:`n` is the
    number of controls. Compare this with ``mct`` mode which uses :math:`n-2`
    ancillary qubits for the same strategy. The difference is due to the fact
    that in ``mct`` the chain ends with a single ``ccx`` writing on the target
    qubit, while in ``mcmt`` the chain ends with the ``ccx`` writing on an
    ancillary qubit, which is then used as the control qubit of the single-control
    gate function.

    Aqua's mcmt operation can be invoked from a ``QuantumCircuit`` object
    using the ``mcmt`` API, which expects a list ``q_controls`` of control qubits,
    a list ``q_targets`` of target qubits, a list ``q_ancilla`` of ancillary qubits
    that must be off and are promised to be off after the function call, and a
    function ``single_control_gate_fun`` which is the generic function to
    apply to the ``q_targets`` qubits. An optional keyword argument ``mode`` can
    also be passed in to indicate the mode, but at the moment only the ``'basic'``
    mode is supported. If omitted, this argument defaults to ``'basic'``.


.. _logic_gates:

.. topic:: Boolean Logic Gates

    Aqua also provides the logic *AND* and *OR* gates to mirror the corresponding classic logic operations.
    *OR* gates are converted to *AND* gates using De Morgan's Law.
    *AND* gates are implemented using :ref:`mct`.

    The ``AND`` and ``OR`` gates can be invoked from a ``QuantumCircuit`` object.
    They both expect a ``qr_variables`` register holding the variable qubits,
    a ``qb_target`` qubit for holding the result,
    a ``qr_ancillae`` register to use as ancilla,
    an optional ``flags`` list of ``+1``, ``0``, or ``-1`` values
    indicating the signs or omissions of the variable qubits,
    and an optional ``mct_mode`` flag for specifying the mode to use for ``mct``.


.. _boolean-logic-expr:

.. topic:: Boolean Logic Circuits

    Aqua provides a simple set of tools for constructing circuits
    from simple Boolean logic expressions.
    Currently three types of expressions are supported:
    Conjunctive Normal Forms (``CNF``), Disjunctive Normal Forms (``DNF``), and
    Exclusive Sum of Products (``ESOP``).
    They are also used internally by Aqua for constructing various :ref:`oracles`.
    For initialization of each of the three types of objects,
    the corresponding logic expression
    can be specified as a tuple corresponding to the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    of the desired expression,
    where each literal's absolute value indicates a variable,
    and a negative sign indicates the negation of the corresponding variable.
    The logic operations represented by the inner and outer lists
    depend on the particular type (CNF, DNF, or ESOP) of objects being created.
    For example, below is the AST for a simple CNF expression:

    .. code:: python

      ('and',
        ('or', ('lit', 1), ('lit', -2)),
        ('or', ('lit', -1), ('lit', 2)))

    The ``CNF``, ``DNF``, and ``ESOP`` objects, upon the aforementioned AST initialization,
    can generate their corresponding circuits from the API call ``construct_circuit``,
    which takes a ``circuit`` object to extend from,
    a ``variable_register`` for holding the variables of the logic expression,
    a ``clause_register`` for holding the intermediate results of all clauses of the expression,
    an ``output_register`` for holding the result,
    an ``ancillary_register`` for all other ancillae,
    and an ``mct_mode`` flag for specifying the mode to use for ``mct``.
    All these arguments are optional can will be properly handled if omitted.


.. _fourier-transform-circuits:

.. topic:: Quantum Fourier Transform Circuits

    Quantum Fourier Transform is another technique commonly used in quantum algorithms,
    for example, Phase Estimation and the Shor's factoring algorithm.
    The ``FourierTransformCircuits`` class in Aqua's ``circuits`` library
    is capable of constructing, for any specified number ``num_qubits`` of qubits,
    both the normal quantum Fourier transform (qft) circuits
    and the *inverse* quantum Fourier transform (iqft) circuits,
    as can be specified by the ``inverse`` Boolean flag.
    For each, an ``approximation_degree`` can also be specified
    to build the approximation circuits with the desired approximation degree.

    Besides being directly exposed as circuits,
    ``qft`` and ``iqft`` are also accessible as Aqua's pluggable ``components``.
    More detailed discussion on quantum Fourier transform can be found at :ref:`iqft`.


.. _statevector_circuit:

.. topic:: Arbitrary State Vector Circuit

    The circuit library also includes the ability to construct circuits from arbitrary state vectors,
    via the ``StateVectorCircuit`` class,
    which can be initialized using any arbitrary input state vector.
    The ``construct_circuit`` method,
    which takes optional ``circuit`` and ``register`` parameters,
    can then build the corresponding circuit
    using the basis ``u1``, ``u2``, ``u3``, ``cx``, and ``id`` gates.
    This functionality is also exposed via
    the ``CUSTOM`` mode of Aqua's ``InitialState`` pluggable component,
    which is detailed at :ref:`custom-initial-states`.
