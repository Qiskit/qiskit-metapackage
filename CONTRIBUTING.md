# Contributing

The documentation and benchmarking of Qiskit is contained in this repository. To contribute
to them please read the
[contributing guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html).


## Documentation

The documentation of Qiskit is in the ``docs`` directory. The
documentation is generated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org). In the main directory are the installing and general files. Once a pull request is accepted the documentation will be auto-generated and rendered at [https://qiskit.org/documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation).

To edit the documentation, edit the rst files directly and then a html version can be made using:

```bash
    $> make doc
```

The local html version of the documentation can be found at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.
