## Documentation

The documentation of Qiskit is in the ``docs`` directory. The
documentation is generated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org). In the main directory are the installing and general files and then in each subdirectory contains documentation for each element of Qiskit. Once a pull request is accepted the documentation will be auto-generated and rendered at [https://qiskit.org/documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation).

To edit the documentation, edit the rst files directly and then a html version can be made using:

```bash
    $> make doc
```

The local html version of the documentation can be found at `docs/_build/html/index.html`.  


## Versioning

The meta-package started with version `0.7` to respect the continuity of `qiskit` versions. The
Terra element did the same to provide continuity with its own history.

Details on the versioning procedure are documented here:
<https://qiskit.org/documentation/versioning.html>
