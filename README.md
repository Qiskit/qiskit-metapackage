**Qiskit** is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, algorithms, and application modules.

## Installation

The best way of installing `qiskit` is by using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install qiskit
```

See [install](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) Qiskit for detailed instructions, how to use virtual environments, and
build from source standalone versions of the individual Qiskit elements and components.

## Qiskit Packaging

The Qiskit project used to be made up of many components. However, it is now only comprised of the [**Qiskit Terra**](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra)
project and the Qiskit meta-package contained in this repository only installs that.

### Using quantum services

If you are interested in using quantum services, you can check out [the Providers page](https://qiskit.org/providers/) for the list of available providers that Qiskit supports.
