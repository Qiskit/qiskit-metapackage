Tasks Template
==============

Copy this template into the file that you're writing to get started writing an explanation of how
users can complete this task.

This template offers suggestions for how to organize a document that describes how to complete a
task.

Only *one* task should be on a page. Having a page with multiple different or unrelated tasks is
difficult to navigate and read.

Task Description
----------------

* What happens when a user completes this task?

* Why or in what circumstances would someone want to do this?

* What Qiskit features are used?

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* What software, packages, configurations or tools do users need to complete before starting?

Task procedure
--------------

The steps to complete the process.

**Note:** Sphinx cannot auto build bulleted lists with line breaks, which causes formatting
problems with the 100 character line limit for Qiskit's documentation. If your steps are more than
one line long, hardcode the numbered steps by using `1.`, `2.`, etc instead of `#.` or `*`.

#. The first step to get started.

#. Use code formatting for commands and code block examples.

Next steps
----------

* What are some other things that users might want to do after they finish this step?
