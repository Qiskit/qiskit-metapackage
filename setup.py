    # qiskit 0.7 metapackage has a bug for which qiskit 0.6.1 cannot correctly
    # upgrade to 0.7: some Terra files are deleted when removing qiskit 0.6.1
    # before installing qiskit 0.7 but after installing its dependencies. More
    # detailed info is provided at:
    # https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/27#issue-396844438
    # https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/27#issuecomment-455598103
    #
    # The fix overrides 'install' and 'develop' setuptools commands to force
    # reinstalling 'qiskit-terra' after installation to restore the missing files.
    #
    # For this fix to work, we cannot distribute a wheel version of the metapackage
    # (which does not provide any advantage right now). We can remove the fix once
    # we don't support updating from 0.6.
