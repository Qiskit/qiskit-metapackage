# Qiskit RFCs
The purpose of a Qiskit Request for Comments (RFC) is to communicate and engage with the community in the development and direction of Qiskit. RFCs enable engineering and research stakeholders to communicate design changes.

# Template
Use the [RFC template](0000-template.md) to prepare your RFC.

A RFC consists of the following sections:
- Header table
- Summary
- Motivation
- User Benefit
- Design Proposal
- Detailed Design
- Questions
- Future Extensions

# Process
To be decided

# RFC Life-cycle
To be decided

# Why RFCs?
To be completed

# When Should You Write an RFC?
RFC's should be reserved for 'large' engineering items. By this we mean changes where the engineering path is not immediately clear and needs to be deconstructed by the larger Qiskit team.

Questions you might ask yourself:
- Will the implementation involve many developers?
- Will the implementation cross multiple points in the stack?
- Will the changes cause ramifications for the average user?
- Does the project require approvals from outside sources?
